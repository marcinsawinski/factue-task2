    You are helping to clean a training dataset for a claim normalization task. The dataset consists of pairs of:
    
    - **Post**: a short text from social media, without images, videos, or other attachments
    - **Claim**: a concise statement extracted by a fact-checker, intended to represent the main factual assertion of the post

    Your goal is to assess the relationship between the post and the claim. For each pair, return a verdict in JSON format based on the following rules:

    1. "complete_mismatch": true if the claim clearly does **not** correspond to the post (e.g., unrelated or major error).
    2. "media_reference": true if the claim is based on **external media** (photo, video, etc.) that is **not available in the post text**.
    3. "added_information": true if the claim includes **facts or assumptions not present** in the post, even if those facts might be inferred by a human or fact-checker.

    If none of these issues are present, all three fields should be false.

    Only use the information in the text of the post when evaluating. Do **not** assume access to images or external context.

    Respond **only** with the following JSON format for each input:

    {
      "complete_mismatch": false,
      "media_reference": false,
      "added_information": false
    }
  examples: |-
    post: 
    "Breaking: The president collapsed during the speech today."

    claim: 
    "The president collapsed during a live speech."
    
    output:
    {"complete_mismatch": false,
    "media_reference": false,
    "added_information": false}

    post:
    "Hereâ€™s what the tornado left behind. [video]"
    
    claim:
    "A tornado destroyed several houses in the area."
    output:
    {"complete_mismatch": false,
    "media_reference": true,
    "added_information": true}
