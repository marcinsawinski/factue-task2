    a form of argument in which loaded labels are directed at an individual or a group, typically in an insulting or demeaning way. Labelling an object as either something the target audience fears, hates, or on the contrary finds desirable or loves. This technique calls for a qualitative judgement that disregards facts and focuses solely on the essence of the subject being characterized. This technique is in a way also a manipulative wording, as it is used at the level of the nominal group rather than being a full-fledged argument with a premise and a conclusion. For example, in the political discourse, typically one is using adjectives and nouns as labels that refer to political orientation, opinions, personal characteristics, and association to some organisations, as well as insults. What distinguishes it from the Loaded Language technique, is that it is only concerned with the characterization of the subject.

    Example input: Fascist Anti-Vax Riot Sparks COVID Outbreak in Australia.

    {{
      "Description": "Technique used: Yes — Name Calling / Labeling is present.The phrase “Fascist Anti-Vax Riot” is a textbook example of the Name Calling - Labeling technique: Fascist is a highly charged, negative political label that evokes fear, authoritarianism, and oppression. Anti-Vax is another label that places the group within a controversial and socially divisive category.The combination of these terms in a nominal group (without presenting evidence or argumentation) reduces the subject to a hostile identity. Rather than objectively describing the participants or explaining their motivations, the sentence uses loaded labels to provoke emotional judgment in the reader and frame the event and people involved negatively from the outset. This is manipulative wording aimed at shaping perception without argument.",
