  technique_name: Questioning the Reputation
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique is used to attack the reputation of the target by making strong negative claims about it, focusing specially on undermining its character and moral stature rather than relying on an argument about the topic. Whether the claims are true or false is irrelevant for the effective use of this technique. Smears can be used at any point in a discussion. One particular way of using this technique is to preemptively call into question the reputation/credibility of an opponent, before he had any chance to express himself, therefore biasing the audience perception. Hence, one of the name of that technique is “poisoning the well.” The main difference between Casting Doubt and Questioning the reputation technique is that the former focuses on questioning the capacity, the capabilities, and the credibility of the target, while the latter targets undermining the overall reputation, moral qualities, behaviour, etc.

    Example input: I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of history

      "Description": "Yes, the 'Questioning the Reputation' technique is used in the input. The speaker preemptively undermines the opponent by labeling their forthcoming argument as 'fallacious, incoherent, illogical.'' This is not a direct rebuttal of the argument itself but an attack on the opponent’s reliability and intellectual honesty. The speaker attempts to bias the audience against the opponent before they have spoken, which is a classic case of poisoning the well—a subtype of Questioning the Reputation. The emphasis is on discrediting the opponent’s character and trustworthiness rather than addressing the actual content of their argument.",
      "Verdict": True,
