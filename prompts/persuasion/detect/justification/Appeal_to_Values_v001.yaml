constants:
  technique_name: Appeal to Values
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique gives weigh to an idea by linking it to values seen by the targe audience as positive. These values are presented as an authoritative reference in order to support or t reject an argument.
  
    Examples of such values are, for instance: tradition, religion, ethics, age, fairness, liberty, democracy, peace, transparency, etc. When such values are mentioned outside the context of a proper argument by simply using certain adjectives or nouns as a way of characterizing something or someone, such references fall under another label, namely, Loaded Language, which is a form of Manipulative Wording. 
  
    Example input: It’s standard practice to pay men more than women so we’ll continue adhering to the same standards this company has always followed.

    Output **only** valid JSON, for example:
    {{
      "Description": "This statement uses the {technique_name} technique by referencing tradition or established standards as a justification for a current (and potentially unethical) practice. The underlying value appealed to is continuity with the past, implying that something is correct or acceptable simply because it aligns with historical practice. No independent justification is given for why the practice is fair or appropriate — the appeal to tradition is the argument.",
      "Verdict": True,
    }}
