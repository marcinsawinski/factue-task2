# ATTACK ON REPUTATION
Name_Calling-Labeling:
  technique_name: Name Calling - Labeling
  technique_desc: |-
    Name Calling - Labeling is a form of argument in which loaded labels are directed at an individual or a group, typically in an insulting or demeaning way, to evoke a strong emotional response, without providing factual support. This technique involves characterizing a subject with qualitative judgments that evoke fear, hatred, or desirability, often disregarding factual evidence. It is characterized by manipulative wording that targets the essence of the subject being characterized, often using adjectives and nouns as labels that refer to political orientation, personal characteristics, opinions, and associations, in a derogatory manner. In political discourse, it often employs labels referring to political orientation, opinions, personal characteristics, and associations, as well as insults. Name Calling - Labeling reinforces social divisions and biases by framing the labeled individuals or groups in a negative light, creating an in-group versus out-group dynamic. It exploits existing prejudices or stereotypes to enhance its impact and influence the audience's attitudes and beliefs without engaging in rational discourse. Additionally, it can further entrench the audience's views and potentially lead to polarization, as it simplifies complex issues into binary categories that discourage nuanced understanding. The absence of such labeling in a text indicates that this technique has not been employed. This technique specifically focuses on the impact of the labels rather than the content of the argument itself, often in a manipulative manner, and can be particularly effective in shaping public perception and opinion in a way that aligns with the speaker's agenda. It is distinct from Loaded Language as it emphasizes characterization rather than full arguments and involves qualitative judgments that disregard facts, distinguishing it from other forms of loaded language.
  input_example: Fascist Anti-Vax Riot Sparks COVID Outbreak in Australia.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Technique used: Yes — Name Calling / Labeling is present.Fascist is a highly charged, negative political label that evokes fear, authoritarianism, and oppression. Anti-Vax is another label that places the group within a controversial and socially divisive category. The combination of these terms without presenting evidence or argumentation reduces the subject to a hostile identity. Rather than objectively describing the participants or explaining their motivations, the sentence uses labels to provoke emotional judgment in the reader and frame the event and people involved negatively from the outset. This is manipulative wording aimed at shaping perception without argument.",
    "verdict": true}


Guilt_by_Association:
  technique_name: Guilt by Association
  technique_desc: |-
    Attacking the opponent or an activity by associating it with another group, activity, or concept that has sharp negative connotations for the target audience, often by implying that the opponent's actions lead to negative consequences or suggesting that their actions result in harmful outcomes. The most common example, which has given its name in the literature (i.e. Reduction ad Hitlerum) to that technique, is making comparisons to Hitler and the Nazi regime. However, it is important to emphasize that this technique is not restricted to comparisons to that group only. More precisely, this can be done by claiming a link or an equivalence between the target of the technique to any individual, group, or event in the presence or in the past, which has or had an unquestionable negative perception (e.g., was considered a failure), or is depicted in such a way.
  input_example: Manohar is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work. This is
    the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support. Extremists like
    Manohar should not be taken seriously.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example uses Guilt by Association by discrediting Manohar's support for equal pay by linking it to 'extreme feminist groups,' which the speaker implies have negative connotations. The intent is to undermine Manohar's credibility by associating him with a group perceived negatively by the target audience, rather than addressing his argument directly.",
    "verdict": true}


Doubt:
  technique_name: Casting Doubt
  technique_desc: |-
    Casting doubt on the character or the personal attributes of someone or something in order to question their general credibility or quality, instead of using a proper argument related to the topic. This can be done by highlighting inconsistencies in their actions or statements, referencing failures or inefficiencies in processes or systems, and discussing the target's professional background or actions that suggest incompetence or negligence, thereby discrediting their argument or proposals. Casting doubt can also be achieved by referring to unsuccessful actions or events carried out or planned by the entity, or by making strong assertions that challenge the effectiveness or intentions of a policy or action. Additionally, it can involve expressing skepticism about the effectiveness or quality of a process or outcome. The technique is characterized by explicit statements or implications that challenge the integrity or reliability of the subject, often leading the audience to question the validity of the subject's claims or arguments. This includes explicit references to the target's credibility or past failures, as well as actions or events that are perceived as likely to result in failure to achieve planned goals. Furthermore, it often involves contrasting positive attributes of one group with negative attributes of another to create skepticism about the latter. It often includes asserting that the individual lacks knowledge or awareness of critical issues, which further undermines their credibility. The technique is characterized by the presence of specific claims or insinuations that undermine credibility, often focusing on perceived shortcomings or failures of the target, and is marked by negative implications or insinuations about the target's reliability or effectiveness. This can also include highlighting inconsistencies in their actions or priorities, such as their focus on less significant issues while ignoring more pressing problems, and suggesting that others have overlooked or ignored critical information, thereby questioning their integrity or intentions. Additionally, it can involve questioning the specifics or details of a claim, such as by asking for missing information, which implies that the original statement may not be trustworthy. It can also include questioning the engagement or presence of an audience in discussions, implying a lack of credibility in their participation, and expressing uncertainty about how to engage with the audience, thereby questioning their interest and credibility. The technique can also involve highlighting the minority status of dissenting opinions to undermine their legitimacy. The technique is characterized by an explicit challenge to the credibility of the source or the information presented, and it can be employed as a tactic to divert attention from the actual argument by focusing on the perceived flaws of the individual or entity involved.
  input_example: This task is quite complex. Is his professional background, experience
    and the time left sufficient to accomplish the task at hand?
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Technique detected: Casting Doubt. How it was used: The paragraph casts doubt on the subject’s professional background, experience, and available time, questioning whether these are sufficient to complete the task. Instead of evaluating the task or the individual’s argument on its own merits, it undermines their credibility and capability through personal attributes. This aligns with the definition of the Casting Doubt technique, as it subtly challenges the person’s qualifications rather than directly engaging with the substance of the task itself.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Hypocrisy:
  technique_name: Appeal to Hypocrisy
  technique_desc: |-
    The target of the technique is attacked on its reputation by charging them with hypocrisy or inconsistency, either explicitly by calling out hypocrisy directly, or implicitly by highlighting contradictions between their past statements or actions and their current claims. This includes showing how similar actions are treated differently based on the target's alignment with certain interests. A special way of calling out hypocrisy is by stating that someone who criticizes you for something you did also did it in the past, thereby showing inconsistency in their stance, or by contrasting current claims with past actions. This includes instances where someone criticizes another for a behavior they themselves have exhibited, thereby undermining their credibility and moral authority in the discussion. It particularly applies when the critic has previously engaged in the same behavior they are condemning or when their actions contradict their stated goals. Additionally, it can involve highlighting specific instances where the individual claims to uphold certain principles or standards but acts in a manner that directly contradicts those claims. The technique is also evident when a person's claims are directly contradicted by factual evidence or statistics, further emphasizing the inconsistency in their position. Furthermore, the technique often involves questioning the memory or awareness of the audience regarding the target's past actions, thereby manipulating perceptions of the target's credibility. This technique is particularly effective when the target's criticisms are juxtaposed with their own similar past behaviors, reinforcing the perception of hypocrisy. It also encompasses situations where the critic's own past behaviors are revealed, thereby illustrating their inconsistency and further attacking their credibility.
  input_example: How can you demand that I eat less meat to reduce my carbon footprint
    if you yourself drive a big SUV and fly for holidays to Bali?
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example contains an Appeal to Hypocrisy because it discredits the argument for eating less meat to reduce the carbon footprint by pointing out that the person making this demand is themselves acting inconsistently by driving a big SUV and flying for holidays, rather than directly addressing the merit of the argument.",
    "verdict": true}


Questioning_the_Reputation:
  technique_name: Questioning the Reputation
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique is used to attack the reputation of the target by making strong negative claims about it, focusing especially on undermining its character and moral stature rather than relying on an argument about the topic. Whether the claims are true or false is irrelevant for the effective use of this technique. Smears can be used at any point in a discussion. One particular way of using this technique is to preemptively call into question the reputation/credibility of an opponent, before they have any chance to express themselves, therefore biasing the audience's perception. The main difference between Casting Doubt and Questioning the Reputation technique is that the former focuses on questioning the capacity, capabilities, and credibility of the target, while the latter targets undermining the overall reputation, moral qualities, behavior, etc. This technique is characterized by explicit negative claims or insinuations about the target's character or integrity, which can manifest as personal attacks, character assassination, or the spreading of rumors. It often aims to create a lasting negative impression that can influence the audience's perception beyond the immediate context of the discussion and may involve the use of emotionally charged language to elicit a strong reaction from the audience. Additionally, this technique often involves direct questioning of the actions or integrity of the target to provoke doubt in the audience's mind, and it can also include the use of anecdotal evidence or selective information to reinforce negative perceptions. Furthermore, it often involves linking the target to negative behaviors or outcomes to damage their standing, and it may exploit existing biases or stereotypes to enhance the effectiveness of the attack. The technique is characterized by direct attacks on the target's character or moral standing, emphasizing the intent to damage the target's reputation rather than engage in substantive debate. This technique often involves rhetorical questions that challenge the target's integrity or actions.
  input_example: I hope I presented my argument clearly. Now, my opponent will attempt
    to refute my argument by his own fallacious, incoherent, illogical version of
    history.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Yes, the 'Questioning the Reputation' technique is used in the input. The speaker preemptively undermines the opponent by labeling their forthcoming argument as 'fallacious, incoherent, illogical. This is not a direct rebuttal of the argument itself but an attack on the opponent’s reliability and intellectual honesty. The speaker attempts to bias the audience against the opponent before they have spoken, which is a classic case of poisoning the well—a subtype of Questioning the Reputation. The emphasis is on discrediting the opponent’s character and trustworthiness rather than addressing the actual content of their argument.",
    "verdict": true}


# JUSTIFICATION
Flag_Waving:
  technique_name: Flag Waving
  technique_desc: |-
    Flag Waving persuasion technique involves justifying or promoting an idea by appealing to the pride or benefits of a specific group, often through emotional manipulation rather than logical argumentation. This technique is characterized by references that resonate with the feelings of a particular group, such as national pride, race, gender, or political preference, and aims to evoke a sense of belonging or identity related to that group. It can manifest in various forms, including direct statements of pride, expressions of gratitude, or actions that are framed to evoke a sense of loyalty or emotional connection to a group, as well as contextual references that highlight their struggles or needs. The connection to nationalism, patriotism, or benefit for an idea, group, or country might be fully undue and is usually based on the presumption that the recipients already have certain beliefs, biases, and prejudices about the given issue. It can be seen as an appeal to emotions instead of logic of the audience, aiming to manipulate them to win an argument. Additionally, it emphasizes the audience's identity and values, further enhancing the emotional connection to the message being conveyed. This technique often relies on emotional appeals that resonate with the audience's existing beliefs, biases, or prejudices and can include both direct statements of pride and indirect references that evoke group identity. It typically involves references to group identity, such as nationality, race, or political affiliation, to manipulate the audience's emotions rather than presenting logical arguments, reinforcing their emotional responses to the message. Furthermore, the Flag Waving technique sets a context for further arguments, leveraging the emotional resonance to strengthen the overall persuasive impact. It also involves invoking feelings of nationalism and patriotism to manipulate the audience's perception and arguments. The stereotypical example would be national pride; however, the target group it applies to might be any group, including those related to race, gender, or political preference, and it can appear in both structured arguments and casual mentions that evoke group feelings, particularly by highlighting the impact on the group's well-being. This technique is characterized by emotional resonance rather than logical argumentation, aiming to manipulate the audience's feelings through references to group identity, nationalism, or shared values. It is typically aimed at manipulating the audience's beliefs or biases through emotional appeals that resonate with the feelings of a particular group, emphasizing the audience's sense of identity and collective sentiment. Additionally, it can include references to the benefits for a community, thereby resonating with the audience's feelings of national or group identity, and highlighting the pride of the group or the advantages that the idea may bring to them.
  input_example: We should make America great again, and restrict the immigration
    laws.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example uses Flag Waving by appealing to national pride with the phrase 'We should make America great again,' and justifying stricter immigration laws as a means to benefit the country. It evokes patriotic feelings to promote the idea, rather than relying solely on logical argument.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Authority:
  technique_name: Appeal to Authority
  technique_desc: |-
    The Appeal to Authority technique involves giving weight to an argument, an idea, or information by stating that a recognized authority supports the information or claim. This technique is characterized by the text's tone indicating reliance on the authority's credibility to justify claims. It is important that the authority is explicitly mentioned and that the argument relies on their status to lend support to the information presented, rather than making general statements about an individual's qualities without citing their authority. The entity mentioned as an authority may, but does not need to be, an actual valid authority in the domain-specific field to discuss a particular topic or to be considered and serve as an expert. What distinguishes this technique from simply sourcing information is that the tone of the text capitalizes on the weight of the alleged authority to justify some information, claim, or conclusion. This includes referencing the opinions or experiences of individuals in relevant fields, such as professionals or experts, to support claims. The technique is characterized by the use of authoritative statements to bolster arguments, often without critical examination of the authority's validity. The tone of the text should indicate that the authority's status is leveraged to support the argument, rather than simply presenting information or statistics without context. The technique is explicitly identified when the authority is presented as a source that supports the argument being made. Referencing a valid authority is not a logical fallacy, while referencing an invalid authority is a logical fallacy, and both are captured within this label. In particular, a self-reference as an authority falls under this technique as well, where the author uses their own credentials or experiences to support their argument.
  input_example: Since the Pope said that this aspect of the doctrine is true we should
    add it to the creed.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example uses Appeal to Authority by justifying that 'this aspect of the doctrine is true' simply because the Pope said it. It gives weight to the claim based on the authority of the Pope, capitalizing on his status as an authority figure.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Popularity:
  technique_name: Appeal to Popularity
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique gives weight to an argument or idea by justifying it on the basis that allegedly “everybody” (or the vast majority) agrees with it or “nobody” disagrees with it. The target audience is encouraged to adopt the same idea by considering “everyone else” as an authority, and to join in and take the course of the same action. Here, “everyone else” might refer to the general public, key entities and actors in a certain domain, or even entire countries. This technique can also involve attempts to persuade the audience not to do something because “nobody else is taking the same action,” thereby leveraging the fear of social exclusion or being out of step with the majority. Additionally, references to public opinion or widespread acknowledgment of an issue can also indicate the use of this technique.
  input_example: Because everyone else goes away to college, it must be the right
    thing to do.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example contains Appeal to Popularity because it justifies going away to college by claiming that 'everyone else' does it, implying that it must be the right course of action simply because it is popular.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Values:
  technique_name: Appeal to Values
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique gives weight to an idea by linking it to values seen by the target audience as positive, such as tradition, religion, ethics, age, fairness, liberty, democracy, peace, transparency, safety, integrity, and accountability, to support or reject an argument. The values must be explicitly referenced as authoritative references to support or reject an argument, rather than merely being implied or mentioned in passing. Additionally, the appeal to values can be particularly effective when the values resonate deeply with the audience's identity or beliefs, enhancing the emotional connection to the argument. It is important that the values are not only referenced but are also relevant and significant to the audience's context, ensuring that the appeal is meaningful and impactful. The technique is distinct from Loaded Language, which involves using certain adjectives or nouns to characterize something or someone without a proper argument. Furthermore, the values should not be presented in a critical context, as this may undermine their perceived authority and relevance. The appeal to values should also avoid vague or generic references, focusing instead on specific values that hold particular significance for the audience. Additionally, the values must be presented in a positive context to reinforce their authority and relevance in supporting the argument. If values are mentioned without a clear connection to an argument, they may fall under Loaded Language, highlighting the necessity of a direct link between the values and the argument being made. The presentation of these values should actively support or reject an argument, particularly in contexts where the audience's well-being or moral standards are at stake, rather than merely stating facts, ensuring a clear and persuasive connection. Moreover, the values should not be used solely for emotional appeals but must serve a clear purpose in the argumentation process. It should be noted that mere negative characterizations or references to values without a constructive appeal do not qualify as the Appeal to Values technique. Additionally, these values must be referenced in a way that supports or rejects an argument, rather than merely describing actions or positions, and should not be discussed in a procedural context.
  input_example: It’s standard practice to pay men more than women so we’ll continue
    adhering to the same standards this company has always followed.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "This statement uses the Appeal to Values technique by referencing tradition or established standards as a justification for a current (and potentially unethical) practice. The underlying value appealed to is continuity with the past, implying that something is correct or acceptable simply because it aligns with historical practice. No independent justification is given for why the practice is fair or appropriate — the appeal to tradition is the argument.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice:
  technique_name: Appeal to Fear - Prejudice
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique aims at promoting or rejecting an idea through the audience's fear or repulsion towards that idea or its alternatives, often by exploiting preconceived judgments and suggesting dire consequences. The alternative could be the status quo, in which case the current situation is described in a frightening manner, using loaded language to create a sense of fear. It can involve describing a scary scenario related to the idea or its consequences, often using emotionally charged language that implies dire outcomes to provoke an immediate emotional response rather than a rational evaluation of the situation. Additionally, it may exploit societal prejudices or stereotypes to amplify fear, further manipulating the audience's emotional state and decision-making process. The technique often involves creating a narrative that emphasizes the dangers or negative outcomes associated with a particular group or political decision, thereby inciting fear and prejudice. It may also include questioning the audience's trust or safety regarding a particular subject. If the fear is linked to the consequences of a decision, it may overlap with Appeal to Consequences, and if only two alternatives are presented explicitly, it may also involve the False Dilemma technique. The presence of fear-inducing language or implications is essential for identifying this technique. It can be identified through language that evokes fear or repulsion regarding a concept or its consequences, and it often creates a sense of urgency, compelling the audience to act quickly based on fear rather than careful consideration. The absence of fear or negative implications in the message indicates that this technique is not being used. This technique often employs loaded language to evoke strong emotional responses, further enhancing its persuasive impact, and it may create a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action.
  input_example: It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that
    there is nothing problematical about Amoris laetitia. A moral catastrophe is self-evidently
    underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Yes, the Appeal to Fear – Prejudice technique is used. The statement employs Appeal to Fear by invoking the notion of a “moral catastrophe” and suggesting that it is “self-evidently underway.” This creates a sense of urgency, danger, and moral decline tied to the acceptance or uncritical treatment of Amoris laetitia (a Church document). The use of emotionally charged language like “catastrophe” and the implication that denial is dishonest suggests that supporting or ignoring the issue poses a grave threat to the Church’s integrity. This taps into the audience’s potential prejudices or fears about moral decay within religious institutions.",
    "verdict": true}


# DISTRACTION
Straw_Man:
  technique_name: Strawman
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique consists in making an impression of refuting the argument of the opponent’s proposition by replacing it with a false one, which is a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the original argument. Often, this technique is referred to as misrepresentation of the argument. First, a new argument is created via the covert replacement of the original argument with something that appears somewhat related, but is actually different. The newly created argument (the strawman) is then refuted, creating an illusion of having defeated the opponent's real proposition. This technique often appears as an abusive reformulation or explanation of what the opponent actually means or wants, particularly by reducing their argument to an oversimplified or extreme version that can be easily attacked, thereby distorting the original argument further. Fighting a strawman is easier than fighting against a real person, which explains the origin of the name of this technique. This technique requires the presence of an original argument to misrepresent; without such an argument, the technique cannot be applied.
  input_example: Referring to your claim that providing medicare for all citizens
    would be costly and a danger to the free market, I infer that you don’t care if
    people die from not having healthcare, so we are not going to support your endeavour.
  output_example: |-
    { "description": "The example contains the Strawman technique because it misrepresents the original argument. The original argument is about the financial and free-market implications of providing medicare for all citizens. However, it is distorted into a much more extreme position—that the person making the argument doesn't care if people die from lack of healthcare. This exaggeration is then refuted, rather than addressing the original, nuanced point.",
    "verdict": true}


Red_Herring:
  technique_name: Red Herring
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique consists in diverting the attention of the audience from the main topic being discussed by introducing another unrelated topic or issue, making it difficult to address the original argument. The aim is to redirect the argument to something the person doing the redirecting can better respond to or to leave the original topic unaddressed. A clear main topic must be present for the technique to be applicable. The name of this technique comes from the idea that a fish with a strong smell (like a herring) can be used to divert dogs from the scent of someone they are following. This technique may involve introducing a topic that seems related but ultimately distracts from the original issue, thereby redirecting the focus away from the main point. A clear example of this technique would involve specific statements that shift the focus away from the main issue. A strawman (defined earlier) is also a specific type of a red herring in the way that it distracts from the main issue by painting the opponent’s argument in an inaccurate light. Additionally, the red herring technique can manifest through the introduction of irrelevant information that may appear to have some connection but ultimately serves to mislead or confuse the audience regarding the original topic. It can also involve introducing a related context that does not directly address the original issue, further complicating the discussion.
  input_example: Lately, there has been a lot of criticism regarding the quality of
    our product. We’ve decided to have a new sale in response, so you can buy more
    at a lower cost!.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example contains the Red Herring technique because, instead of addressing the criticism about the product's quality, the speaker introduces a new topic—an upcoming sale—to divert attention from the original issue.",
    "verdict": true}


Whataboutism:
  technique_name: Whataboutism
  technique_desc: |-
    A technique that attempts to discredit an opponent’s position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument. Instead of answering a critical question or argument, an attempt is made to retort with a critical counter-question or suggestion that expresses a counteraccusation, e.g., mentioning double standards or what the opponent should have done instead. The intent is to distract from the content of a topic and to switch the topic, often by referencing past actions or failures of the opponent. There is a fine distinction between this technique and Appeal to Hypocrisy, where the former is an attack on the argument and introduces irrelevant information to the main topic, while the latter is an attack on reputation and highlights the hypocrisy of double standards on the same or a very related topic. Whataboutism often involves emotionally charged or unrelated issues to undermine the opponent's stance and can manifest in various forms, such as shifting the focus to the opponent's past behavior or unrelated controversies. Additionally, it may involve a false equivalence, suggesting that the opponent's actions are comparable to the issue at hand, further complicating the discourse and obscuring the original argument. This technique is characterized by the introduction of irrelevant information that diverts attention from the original argument, distinguishing it from mere statements or expressions that do not engage in debate.
  input_example: A nation deflects criticism of its recent human rights violations
    by pointing to the history of slavery in the United States.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example contains Whataboutism because instead of addressing the criticism regarding recent human rights violations, the nation distracts by pointing out an unrelated historical issue (slavery in the United States), thus changing the subject with a counteraccusation and not directly disproving the argument.",
    "verdict": true}


Appeal_to_Pity:
  technique_name: Appeal to Pity
  technique_desc: |-
    A technique that evokes feelings of pity, sympathy, compassion, or guilt in the audience to distract it from focusing on evidence, rational analysis, and logical reasoning, thereby leading the audience to accept the speaker’s conclusion as truthful based solely on these emotions. It specifically involves claims intended to elicit pity or guilt, rather than merely describing emotional situations, often by presenting vulnerable individuals or distressing circumstances, thereby appealing to the audience's sense of empathy rather than their critical thinking.
  input_example: If this person is found guilty of this crime, his ten children will
    be left without a parent at home, therefore the jury must submit a verdict of
    innocence.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example attempts to evoke sympathy for the defendant’s ten children to persuade the jury to return a verdict of innocence, rather than focusing on evidence related to the crime. The appeal is primarily to pity and does not provide logical justification for innocence, thus it exhibits the Appeal to Pity technique.",
    "verdict": true}


# SIMPLIFICATION
Causal_Oversimplification:
  technique_name: Causal Oversimplification
  technique_desc: |-
    Causal Oversimplification is the technique of assuming a single cause or reason for an issue when there are actually multiple contributing factors. This technique can manifest in claims that suggest a direct causal relationship between two events without considering other influences or causes. It has the following logical form(s): (a) Y occurred after X; therefore, X was the only cause of Y, or (b) X caused Y; therefore, X was the only cause of Y+ (although A, B, C...etc. also contributed to Y).
  input_example: School violence has gone up and academic performance has gone down
    since video games featuring violence were introduced. Therefore, video games with
    violence should be banned, resulting in school improvement.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example assumes that violent video games are the sole cause of increased school violence and decreased academic performance, ignoring other potential contributing factors. This matches the definition of Causal Oversimplification, as it attributes a complex issue to just one cause.",
    "verdict": true}


False_Dilemma-No_Choice:
  technique_name: False Dilemma or No Choice
  technique_desc: |-
    Sometimes called the either-or fallacy, a false dilemma is a logical fallacy that presents only two options or sides when there actually are many, often framing one option as undesirable or impossible, which leads the audience to believe that the only viable choice is the other option. One of the alternatives is depicted as a no-go option, reinforcing this perception and forcing the audience to choose the other option. In extreme cases, the author tells the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choices (also referred to as Dictatorship). This technique simplifies complex issues into binary choices, ignoring other possibilities and nuances. It can be identified when the author explicitly limits the options to two, disregarding other possibilities. This technique is characterized by the clear presentation of limited options, where the audience is led to believe that they must choose one of the presented alternatives without considering other possibilities. It often involves framing one option as necessary while dismissing the other as irrelevant or undesirable. A clear indication of this technique is the absence of any mention of alternative options or the framing of a situation as having only two possible outcomes. It often emphasizes the negative consequences of the rejected option to strengthen the perceived necessity of the chosen option and involves framing a situation in such a way that opposing a proposed action is equated with endorsing a negative outcome. Additionally, it implies that any deviation from the presented choices is invalid or unacceptable, further constraining the audience's perception of available options and ignoring other potential solutions or outcomes. Furthermore, this technique implies that if one option is not taken, the other is the only viable choice, disregarding other possibilities and suggesting that the audience must choose between the presented options, thereby disregarding other viable alternatives. It often creates a sense of urgency or necessity, compelling the audience to choose one of the presented options. This technique can be identified when a statement restricts the options to two, disregarding other possibilities.
  input_example: There is no alternative to Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Either one takes
    it or one dies.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example presents only two options: taking the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine or dying, ignoring other possible vaccines and outcomes. This is a classic case of the false dilemma technique, as it forces a binary choice where many alternatives exist.",
    "verdict": true}


Consequential_Oversimplification:
  technique_name: Consequential Oversimplification
  technique_desc: |-
    An argument or an idea is rejected and instead of discussing whether it makes sense and/or is valid, the argument affirms, without proof, that accepting the proposition would imply accepting other propositions that are considered negative. This technique follows the logical form: if A happens, then B, C, D, ... will happen, often leading to exaggerated or ludicrous negative outcomes while ignoring the likelihood of these events occurring. The core essence behind this fallacy is an assertion of some ‘first’ event/action leading to a domino-like chain of events that have significant negative effects and consequences, while ignoring and/or understating the likelihood of the sequence of events from the first event leading to the end point. It can also apply when oversimplifying a positive outcome from a complex situation, leading to misleading conclusions. This technique is characterized by a failure to engage with the validity of the original argument and often relies on an exaggerated portrayal of potential negative consequences, as well as a failure to provide evidence for the claimed causal relationships. Additionally, it can be used to promote certain actions by suggesting they will lead to major positive outcomes, with the promise of a significant event in the end, but the key characteristic remains the lack of substantiation for the causal links. This technique typically oversimplifies the likelihood of the events occurring and ignores the complexity and nuances of the situation.
  input_example: If we begin to restrict freedom of speech, this will encourage the
    government to infringe upon other fundamental rights, and eventually this will
    result in a totalitarian state where citizens have little to no control of their
    lives and decisions they make.

    {"description": "The example fits the technique Consequential Oversimplification because it claims that restricting freedom of speech will ultimately lead to a totalitarian state, framing this as a direct chain of progressively worse consequences. It does not provide a nuanced argument about the actual likelihood of each step in the sequence, and it oversimplifies the complex relationship between initial restrictions and the supposed extreme outcome.",

False_Equivalence:
  technique_name: False Equivalence
  technique_desc: |-
    A technique that attempts to treat scenarios that are significantly different as if they had equal merit or significance, particularly by emphasizing one specific shared characteristic between the items of comparison in the argument that is oversimplified or ignores important additional factors. The introduction of this shared characteristic is used to argue that the scenarios are equal, typically following the logical form: A and B share some characteristic X. Therefore, A and B are considered equal, despite significant differences in context or implications. This technique is evident when an argument states that A and B share some characteristic X, leading to the conclusion that A and B are equal, even when the contexts of A and B are fundamentally different. It is important to note that the technique is only applicable when a comparison is explicitly made between two distinct scenarios in a way that suggests they are being treated as equivalent. The technique is not present if the comparison does not imply equality or if it critiques without equating. Additionally, this technique can lead to a distorted understanding of the issues at hand by failing to acknowledge the complexities and nuances that differentiate the scenarios.
  input_example: The introduction or restrictive hours of alcohol sales boosted the
    black market industry, and analogously, one can expect that the introduction of
    too restrictive anti-abortion regulations will lead to growth of the illegal abortion
    business.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example compares the effects of restricting alcohol sales to the effects of restrictive anti-abortion regulations, suggesting that both will similarly lead to black market activities because they share the characteristic of restriction. However, this ignores significant differences in context, social impact, and scale between alcohol and abortion regulations. The comparison treats them as equally impactful due to a shared characteristic, which constitutes false equivalence.",

# CALL
Slogans:
  technique_name: Slogans
  technique_desc: |-
    A brief and striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping, often used to create emotional appeals. Slogans are typically memorable and concise, serving as a rallying cry or persuasive statement. They aim to influence public opinion or behavior by simplifying complex ideas into catchy phrases that resonate with the audience, encapsulating a larger message or sentiment in a way that influences public perception. Crafted to resonate emotionally, slogans enhance their impact and recall, making them powerful tools for communication, specifically designed to persuade or influence opinions and attitudes. Slogans are particularly effective in advertising and political campaigns, capturing attention quickly and conveying a clear message. This makes them integral to campaigns that seek to drive action or change perceptions, often used strategically to create a lasting impression and shape brand identity or political narratives. They are typically found in persuasive contexts rather than purely factual statements, aiming to provoke a strong emotional response and influence attitudes and behaviors. Slogans tend to act as emotional appeals, presented as standalone statements in a recognizable and memorable format, further reinforcing their effectiveness in persuasion. Additionally, slogans are designed to encapsulate a message succinctly, emphasizing their role in influencing opinions and attitudes. They often act as emotional appeals, effectively conveying a message in a concise manner.

Conversation_Killer:
  technique_name: Conversation Killer
  technique_desc: |-
    This includes words or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic by presenting it as an undeniable fact, often by oversimplifying complex issues, asserting a false consensus, or denying the existence of disagreement. They dismiss opposing viewpoints as repetitive or unoriginal, thereby shutting down further inquiry. They often manifest as dismissive statements, oversimplifications, or generalizations that shut down further dialogue, and are a form of Loaded Language, often passing as folk wisdom, intended to end an argument and quell cognitive dissonance. Additionally, they may be used strategically to reinforce existing beliefs and discourage any exploration of alternative perspectives, indicating a clear intent to dismiss opposing views and prevent further dialogue. The presence of such language should be evident in the text to classify it as a Conversation Killer. Examples include statements that simplify complex issues, assert a false consensus, label opposing arguments as unoriginal, or use dismissive language that prevents further discussion, which further illustrates their role in stifling discussion. The absence of such language in a text indicates that the Conversation Killer technique is not present.
  input_example: I’m not so na¨ıve or simplistic to believe we can eliminate wars.
    You can’t change human nature.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example 'Immigrants welcome, racist not!' is a brief and striking phrase that conveys an emotional message, labeling those who oppose immigrants as 'racist.' It functions as a slogan because it is memorable, emotionally charged, and aims to influence public opinion through a simplified, impactful statement.",
    "verdict": true}

Appeal_to_Time:
  technique_name: Appeal to Time
  technique_desc: |-
    The argument is centered around the idea that time has come for a particular action, explicitly indicating that the current moment is significant for the argument being made and emphasizing the urgency and necessity of acting in the present context due to a specific time-related situation. The very timeliness of the idea is part of the argument, often suggesting that delay could result in missed opportunities or negative consequences. Additionally, it may invoke a sense of immediacy, explicitly stating that immediate action is necessary due to current circumstances, and implying that the current context or situation makes the action particularly relevant or necessary right now. It highlights that the urgency and appropriateness of the timing in relation to the action being proposed are crucial components of the argument, reinforcing the idea that immediate action is essential. The emphasis on timeliness serves as a persuasive element, urging individuals to recognize the importance of acting without delay. This technique can also leverage societal or cultural pressures that prioritize promptness, further enhancing the perceived necessity of immediate action. Furthermore, it may appeal to the audience's emotions by creating a sense of fear or anxiety about the consequences of inaction, thereby strengthening the call for immediate response or change. Importantly, the argument focuses on the urgency and timeliness of the action itself, rather than merely discussing the consequences of inaction over time, and emphasizes the appropriateness of the idea in the present moment, highlighting the significance of the current moment in relation to the proposed action and its connection to past events. Additionally, it underscores the importance of addressing current issues, reinforcing the notion that the present context demands immediate attention and action, and suggesting that the current moment is critical for the proposed action. The argument should clearly indicate that a specific action is being advocated for at this moment in time, with the timeliness of the idea being a crucial part of the argument, emphasizing that the urgency and timeliness of the idea are critical elements of the overall persuasion.
  input_example: This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take
    the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises
    of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation
    to the sunlit path of racial justice.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example explicitly invokes the urgency of the present moment and repeatedly uses the phrase 'now is the time' to emphasize immediate action, aligning directly with the appeal to time persuasion technique.",

# MANIPULATIVE WORDING
Loaded_Language:
  technique_name: Loaded Language
  technique_desc: |-
    Loaded Language technique involves the use of specific words and phrases with strong emotional implications (either positive or negative) to influence and convince the audience that an argument is valid or invalid, particularly when such language is used to evoke a strong emotional response or bias in the audience. It is characterized by emotionally charged language that seeks to provoke a strong reaction, aiming to bypass logical reasoning and appeal directly to the audience's feelings. This technique can manipulate perceptions by framing issues in a way that elicits specific emotional reactions, often leading to biased interpretations of the argument presented. Additionally, it can sway opinion by leveraging the emotional weight of language to create a sense of urgency or importance around the issue at hand, often by evoking strong feelings such as shame, pride, anger, sympathy, or admiration, and may involve the use of vivid imagery to enhance the emotional impact of the message. It is important to note that loaded language can also lead to oversimplification of complex issues, as it may reduce nuanced arguments to emotionally charged slogans or catchphrases. Furthermore, loaded language is characterized by the presence of emotionally charged terms that seek to elicit a strong reaction rather than present objective facts, often by evoking strong feelings and moral judgments, and it sways opinion rather than providing a balanced view of the argument. The presence of such language must be evident in the text to determine its use, and this technique is particularly effective when such language is used to provoke strong reactions, specifically designed to influence the audience's perception and emotional response, aiming to sway opinions or feelings. It is also known as Appeal to Argument from Emotive Language. The presence of emotionally charged language rather than neutral or simple expressions is essential for identifying this technique, often characterized by the absence of neutral language. The technique often employs biased language to reinforce emotional appeals, emphasizing the emotional implications of the language used, and it specifically targets the audience's feelings related to the subject matter to enhance its persuasive impact. Additionally, loaded language often involves framing individuals or groups in a particular light, which can further influence the audience's perception and emotional response, and it can evoke fear, anger, or pride to strengthen its persuasive effect.
  input_example: They keep feeding these people with trash. They should stop.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The phrase 'feeding these people with trash' uses strong negative emotional language to provoke disgust or anger in the audience. This is a clear use of Loaded Language, as it frames the situation in a way that is meant to emotionally charge the listener rather than rely on neutral or factual language.",
    "verdict": true}

Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion:
  technique_name: Obfuscation, Intentional Vagueness, Confusion
  technique_desc: |-
    This fallacy uses words that are deliberately not clear, so that the audience may have its own interpretations. For example, an unclear phrase with multiple or unclear definitions is used within the argument and, therefore, does not support the conclusion. Statements that are imprecise and intentionally do not fully or vaguely answer the question posed fall under this category too. The use of vague terms or phrases that can lead to confusion about their meaning is a key indicator of this technique. Additionally, phrases that lack specificity and can lead to confusion about their meaning or implications are also considered part of this technique. Furthermore, the use of ambiguous terms or phrases that lack specific meaning can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. Phrases that describe situations without specific details or clarity can also exemplify this technique, further obscuring the intended message and making it difficult for the audience to discern the actual argument being made. Moreover, phrases that create confusion about the severity or nature of a subject can also exemplify this technique, adding to the overall vagueness and misinterpretation of the argument. The use of ambiguous terms or references that lack specificity contributes to confusion and misinterpretation. The use of ambiguous terms or phrases that can be interpreted in various ways contributes to the obfuscation of the argument.
  input_example: Feathers cannot be dark, because all feathers are light!
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "The example contains intentional vagueness and confusion by using the term 'light.' The word 'light' can have multiple meanings: light in color or light in weight. By employing an ambiguous term, the statement becomes unclear and open to interpretation, leading to confusion about the intended meaning. This aligns with the definition of the technique, which involves using imprecise or unclear language.",
    "verdict": true}


Exaggeration-Minimisation:
  technique_name: Exaggeration - Minimisation
  technique_desc: |-
    This technique consists of either representing something in an excessive manner – by making things larger, better, worse (e.g., the best of the best, quality guaranteed) – or by making something seem less important or smaller than it really is (e.g., saying that an insult was just a joke), downplaying the statements and ignoring the arguments and the accusations made by an opponent. It can also involve using hyperbolic language to emphasize negative actions or consequences while minimizing the perceived importance of accountability. The technique is characterized by clear instances of hyperbole or minimization in the language used, and it can be identified through specific phrases that amplify or diminish the perceived reality of a situation. Additionally, it may involve emphasizing extreme negative situations while neglecting any positive aspects or responses, further skewing the audience's understanding. The technique is evident when there are clear examples of inflated claims or significant downplaying of issues, often leading to a distorted perception of reality.
  input_example: From the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals,
    homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.
  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Yes, the Exaggeration – Minimisation technique is used. The statement uses exaggeration by claiming that “homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.” This presents the presence of homosexual individuals in the Church hierarchy in an excessive manner, suggesting an overwhelming or pervasive scale without providing specific evidence. The phrase “by the thousand” is particularly hyperbolic, aiming to amplify the perceived extent of the phenomenon and possibly provoke emotional or moral reaction.",
    "verdict": true}

Repetition:
  technique_name: Repetition
  technique_desc: |-
    The speaker uses the same word, phrase, story, or imagery repeatedly, at least twice, within a context to persuade the audience, emphasizing the importance or urgency of the message. This includes instances where the repetition is clearly aimed at reinforcing a point or argument, and it encompasses cases where the same element is reiterated multiple times throughout the text, particularly in close proximity, to reinforce the message. The repetition must be evident in the text, specifically through clear and noticeable instances of repetition, emphasizing the emotional or thematic significance of the repeated elements. Additionally, this includes instances where the same elements are reiterated in close proximity to further emphasize a point, particularly through the use of specific phrases that highlight key points or failures. The repetition must occur multiple times within the text to effectively contribute to the persuasive impact, specifically through clear and intentional reiteration of key elements, while also highlighting the importance of the repeated elements and their emotional or thematic significance. The definition also emphasizes the act of repeating these elements multiple times within the discourse as a critical aspect of the technique, specifically by emphasizing key points through reiteration, and it highlights the need for the audience to notice the repeated elements, thereby enhancing the perceived urgency of the message. The speaker employs this technique with the hope that the repetition will lead to persuasion, specifically focusing on instances where the same element is reiterated to emphasize a point, and this repetition must be clearly identifiable within the text. Furthermore, this technique also includes instances where the same concept is reiterated in different forms or contexts, allowing for a broader interpretation of the repeated ideas, including cases where the same concept is reiterated without significant variation. This includes instances where the same concept is emphasized through multiple occurrences, reinforcing the overall persuasive effect, specifically by emphasizing key points or themes through their recurrence, and it also includes cases where the repetition is intended to evoke an emotional response. Additionally, the repetition may be intended to create a rhythm in the message, further enhancing its persuasive quality. This includes instances where the same element is used multiple times within a text or speech, reinforcing the overall message, and it also includes instances where the same element is emphasized multiple times throughout the text, specifically emphasizing the persuasive effect of such repetition. This definition also highlights the importance of direct repetition of the same concept, rather than merely mentioning similar ideas, to strengthen the persuasive impact, specifically through the use of identical or very similar elements in close proximity. If no such repetition is present, the technique is not considered used, as the absence of such repetition indicates that the technique is not applied. This can be identified by the presence of at least one instance of such repetition in the text, specifically with the hope that the repetition will lead to persuading the audience, particularly by emphasizing key terms or concepts that are central to the argument; this can be identified by the presence of identical or similar elements appearing multiple times in the text, particularly within a short span of text, specifically emphasizing the same elements multiple times for effect, and specifically emphasizing the impact of the repeated elements on the audience's perception.

  output_example: |-
    {"description": "Yes, the Repetition technique is used. The phrase “Hurtlocker deserves an Oscar” or close variations of it are repeated multiple times throughout the statement. This repetition reinforces the idea that Hurtlocker is uniquely worthy of the Oscar, aiming to implant this view in the audience’s mind through sheer frequency. The reiteration elevates the film while simultaneously minimizing the merit of other contenders.",
