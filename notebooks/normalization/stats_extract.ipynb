Let me start by understanding what exactly they\\'re asking for.\\n\\nThe input is a short text that seems to be a legal warning about not challenging people to wear face coverings. The instructions are pretty detailed, mentioning things like using only information from the post, avoiding adding new facts, and maintaining a neutral tone. They also want me to retain named entities exactly as written and expand acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nLooking at the sample input, it\\'s a bit formal and legal in nature. The user provided an example where they extracted the main claim about potential liability under the Equality Act 2010. So, I should focus on identifying the key points here: who (the government), what (advice not to challenge wearing face coverings), why (due to reasons like non-compliance leading to discrimination claims).\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add anything extra and stick strictly to the information given. The language should be clear and formal without any emotional qualifiers. Also, I must preserve all named entities exactly as they are, so \"Equality Act 2010\" stays as is.\\n\\nLet me break down the post: it\\'s advising against challenging face covering guidelines because it can lead to personal liability under specific sections of the Equality Act. So the main claim is about potential legal consequences for non-compliance.\\n\\nI should structure this without any markdown, just plain text. Also, I need to make sure that if there are multiple facts, I pick the most important one. In this case, it\\'s the liability aspect tied to the Equality Act sections mentioned.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a handle on it. Now, I\\'ll extract the main claim accordingly.'\n 'Okay, so I need to extract the main claim from a given social media post. The instructions are pretty detailed, but let me try to break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post that talks about government advice regarding face coverings. It mentions not challenging people to wear face coverings because of legal reasons. Specifically, it mentions potential personal liability for employees and possible fines up to £5,000 under the Equality Act 2010, sections 112 and 119.\\n\\nI need to extract only the main claim from this post. The guidelines say to use only information from the post without adding any new facts or context. I should avoid filler words and maintain the original phrasing as much as possible. Also, I must keep the language formal and neutral, avoiding personal or emotional terms.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s clear that the main point is about legal repercussions for not following the advice. The key elements here are the potential liabilities and the specific sections of the Equality Act mentioned. So, the main claim should state that people may be personally liable if they defy the government\\'s advice on face coverings.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I don\\'t add any extra information or change the structure too much. The original post uses some filler like \"This is for GOOD REASON,\" but since we\\'re removing personal qualifiers, that part can go. The main facts are about liability and the specific legal sections, so those should be included.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the post incorrectly mentions section numbers as [sic], which I\\'ll have to preserve. Also, I should expand any acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, but \"Equality Act\" seems fine as is.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the main claim would clearly state the potential liability and reference the specific legal sections without adding or omitting anything extra.'\n \"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking me to extract the main claim from a social media post. They provided an example input and some specific instructions on how I should handle it.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they want. It seems like they're looking for a tool or method to process text from posts on social media, extracting key information in a structured way. The example given is about a government advice regarding face coverings, and the output is a concise statement of the main claim.\\n\\nLooking at their instructions, it's quite detailed. They want me to use only the information from the post without adding any new facts. Also, I should avoid personal or emotional language and maintain a neutral tone. Oh, and I must keep the original phrasing as much as possible while removing filler words.\\n\\nSo, when processing the input, I need to identify the main claim, which in this case is about legal consequences for not wearing a face covering. The post mentions personal liability and specific sections of the Equality Act 2010. My task is to extract the essential details without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI should make sure to preserve named entities like the statute sections mentioned. Also, I need to expand any acronyms unless they're part of an official name. Numerical values should remain unchanged as well.\\n\\nWait, in their example response, they didn't include emojis or hashtags and removed quotes. So, in the output, I shouldn't add those either. The main claim is about liability under specific legal sections, so that's what needs to be highlighted.\\n\\nI think the key here is to parse the post carefully, identify the main assertion, and then present it clearly without any extra information. Also, ensure that the language remains formal and neutral, avoiding any subjective terms.\\n\\nSo, if I were given a new social media post, I would start by reading through it to understand the main point. Then, I'd extract the key elements like who, what, when, where, why—though not all might be present—and structure that into a concise statement. I have to make sure not to miss any important details and stick strictly to the information given.\\n\\nI also need to handle cases where there are multiple facts; in such scenarios, I should prioritize the most significant one. For example, if a post talks about both increased sales and a product recall, the main claim would probably be the sales increase since it's more positive or impactful.\\n\\nAnother thing is maintaining the original language. If the post uses colloquial terms, I shouldn't change them to formal ones unless necessary for clarity. But if the user wants a neutral tone, maybe some terms need to be adjusted slightly without losing the intended meaning.\\n\\nI should also be cautious about removing any filler words or unnecessary phrases while keeping the core message intact. For instance, in the example, they removed quotes and specific mentions of personal liability, but kept the legal sections.\\n\\nLastly, I must ensure that the output is only the final claim text without any additional explanations or formatting. So, after processing, the response should be a clean extract reflecting the main claim as per the instructions.\"]",

The language should be clear and formal without any emotional qualifiers. Also, I must preserve all named entities exactly as they are, so \"Equality Act 2010\" stays as is.\\n\\nLet me break down the post: it\\'s advising against challenging face covering guidelines because it can lead to personal liability under specific sections of the Equality Act. So the main claim is about potential legal consequences for non-compliance.\\n\\nI should structure this without any markdown, just plain text. Also, I need to make sure that if there are multiple facts, I pick the most important one. In this case, it\\'s the liability aspect tied to the Equality Act sections mentioned.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a handle on it. Now, I\\'ll extract the main claim accordingly.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe government advises against challenging people to wear face coverings, as doing so may result in personal liability under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010 for aiding contraventions, potentially leading to fines up to £5,000. Additionally, individuals may be ordered to pay compensation between £900 and £9,000 for discrimination arising from such actions, as per section 119 of the Equality Act 2010.'\n '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to extract the main claim from a given social media post. The instructions are pretty detailed, but let me try to break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post that talks about government advice regarding face coverings. It mentions not challenging people to wear face coverings because of legal reasons. Specifically, it mentions potential personal liability for employees and possible fines up to £5,000 under the Equality Act 2010, sections 112 and 119.\\n\\nI need to extract only the main claim from this post. The guidelines say to use only information from the post without adding any new facts or context. I should avoid filler words and maintain the original phrasing as much as possible. Also, I must keep the language formal and neutral, avoiding personal or emotional terms.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s clear that the main point is about legal repercussions for not following the advice. The key elements here are the potential liabilities and the specific sections of the Equality Act mentioned. So, the main claim should state that people may be personally liable if they defy the government\\'s advice on face coverings.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I don\\'t add any extra information or change the structure too much. The original post uses some filler like \"This is for GOOD REASON,\" but since we\\'re removing personal qualifiers, that part can go. The main facts are about liability and the specific legal sections, so those should be included.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the post incorrectly mentions section numbers as [sic], which I\\'ll have to preserve. Also, I should expand any acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, but \"Equality Act\" seems fine as is.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the main claim would clearly state the potential liability and reference the specific legal sections without adding or omitting anything extra.\\n</think>\\n\\nPeople may be held personally liable for discrimination if they defy government advice on wearing face coverings, potentially facing fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010. Additionally, those who aid contraventions could be ordered to pay compensation between £900 and £9,000 under section 119 of the same act.'\n \"<think>\\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking me to extract the main claim from a social media post. They provided an example input and some specific instructions on how I should handle it.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they want. It seems like they're looking for a tool or method to process text from posts on social media, extracting key information in a structured way. The example given is about a government advice regarding face coverings, and the output is a concise statement of the main claim.\\n\\nLooking at their instructions, it's quite detailed. They want me to use only the information from the post without adding any new facts. Also, I should avoid personal or emotional language and maintain a neutral tone. Oh, and I must keep the original phrasing as much as possible while removing filler words.\\n\\nSo, when processing the input, I need to identify the main claim, which in this case is about legal consequences for not wearing a face covering. The post mentions personal liability and specific sections of the Equality Act 2010. My task is to extract the essential details without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI should make sure to preserve named entities like the statute sections mentioned. Also, I need to expand any acronyms unless they're part of an official name. Numerical values should remain unchanged as well.\\n\\nWait, in their example response, they didn't include emojis or hashtags and removed quotes. So, in the output, I shouldn't add those either. The main claim is about liability under specific legal sections, so that's what needs to be highlighted.\\n\\nI think the key here is to parse the post carefully, identify the main assertion, and then present it clearly without any extra information. Also, ensure that the language remains formal and neutral, avoiding any subjective terms.\\n\\nSo, if I were given a new social media post, I would start by reading through it to understand the main point. Then, I'd extract the key elements like who, what, when, where, why—though not all might be present—and structure that into a concise statement. I have to make sure not to miss any important details and stick strictly to the information given.\\n\\nI also need to handle cases where there are multiple facts; in such scenarios, I should prioritize the most significant one. For example, if a post talks about both increased sales and a product recall, the main claim would probably be the sales increase since it's more positive or impactful.\\n\\nAnother thing is maintaining the original language. If the post uses colloquial terms, I shouldn't change them to formal ones unless necessary for clarity. But if the user wants a neutral tone, maybe some terms need to be adjusted slightly without losing the intended meaning.\\n\\nI should also be cautious about removing any filler words or unnecessary phrases while keeping the core message intact. For instance, in the example, they removed quotes and specific mentions of personal liability, but kept the legal sections.\\n\\nLastly, I must ensure that the output is only the final claim text without any additional explanations or formatting. So, after processing, the response should be a clean extract reflecting the main claim as per the instructions.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe government advice is not to challenge people to wear a face covering due to legal consequences. Failure may result in personal liability for offences under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010, potentially leading to fines up to £5,000. Additionally, individuals may be ordered to pay compensation for disability discrimination cases under section 119 of the Equality Act 2010.\"]",

They provided an example with a post saying \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" and the expected output is \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" So, my task is to take the main claim from similar posts and process it accordingly.\\n\\nLooking at the instructions, I see several points. I must only use information from the post, no additions or inferrals. Maintain intended meaning even if incorrect. Keep details about who, what, where, when, why if present. Retain original phrasing, remove filler. Preserve named entities as written. Use formal, neutral language without hashtags or emojis. Remove personal or subjective qualifiers. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name. Keep numerical values unchanged. Select the most important fact if multiple. Same language as post. If no changes needed, return original.\\n\\nSo, applying this to the example: The post is a question about whether the BJP government will return in 2024. The extracted claim is a statement that they will. I notice that the user changed \"Will our\" to \"Our\", which makes it more assertive but still retains the same meaning. Also, the exclamation mark was removed for formality.\\n\\nI should consider if there are any other posts like this and how to handle varying structures. For example, a different post might use \"Looking forward to 2024 with BJP\" or something similar. The key is to extract the main claim without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m using only the information from the post. No making up facts or context. So if someone says \"BJP will win in 2024\", that\\'s a different angle but still extracts the same main point.\\n\\nIn processing, I should remove any personal or emotional language. For instance, if a user writes \"My BJP government is the best,\" I would extract just \"BJP government.\" Also, maintaining neutrality is important to keep it factual.\\n\\nI wonder about handling acronyms. If someone refers to Bharatiya Janata Party as BJPF (a typo), should I correct it? According to instructions, expand acronyms unless part of an official name. So if \"BJP\" is correct, I shouldn\\'t change it. But if it\\'s a typo like \"Bhajp,\" maybe not. Hmm, need to be careful there.\\n\\nAnother point is numerical values. If the post mentions 2025 instead of 2024, should I adjust it? No, because I can\\'t infer facts; I must keep it as written unless instructed otherwise.\\n\\nI also need to choose the most important fact if multiple are present. So in a post like \"BJP government will return and bring prosperity,\" the main claim is about returning, not the prosperity part.\\n\\nFinally, output only the final claim without any extra info or formatting. So just the processed version of the main claim.'\n 'Okay, so I need to extract the main claim from a social media post. The input given is \"post: short social media text\", and there\\'s an example provided where \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" becomes \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" \\n\\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is being asked. It seems like the task is to take a short social media post, identify the main claim or statement, and then rephrase it in a clear, formal, and neutral tone without adding any extra information. The output should only be the extracted claim.\\n\\nLooking at the example, the original post uses an exclamation mark and some emotional language like \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\". The extracted version removes the exclamation points, keeps the main statement about the BJP government returning in 2024, but makes it more formal without adding any other words or changing the meaning.\\n\\nSo, for another example, if someone posts something like \"I can\\'t wait for the next Avengers movie!\", the main claim would be that an Avengers movie is expected, without the emotional exclamation and personal pronoun.\\n\\nAnother point to consider is removing filler words and maintaining important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, Why. In the example given, it\\'s about the BJP government returning in 2024, so those are the key elements.\\n\\nI also need to preserve named entities exactly as written. So if a post mentions \"Modi\" or another name, that should stay as is.\\n\\nAdditionally, I shouldn\\'t infer new facts but only use information from the post. That means no adding anything beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nExpanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since BJP is an acronym for a political party, it\\'s acceptable to keep it as is without expansion.\\n\\nMaintain numerical values unchanged and keep the same language as the post, avoiding any changes that alter the meaning or tone.\\n\\nSo, if I have a post like \"The new policy will help small businesses!\", the main claim would be \"A new policy aims to assist small businesses.\"\\n\\nAnother example: \"Our school is closing for winter break next week.\" becomes \"Our school will close for winter break next week.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure that any personal or emotional language is removed. For instance, \"I\\'m so happy the BJP won again!\" would become \"The BJP has won again.\"\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts in a post, I should select the most important one. So if someone writes \"The concert sold out and raised money for charity\", the main claim would be about both the concert selling out and raising funds.\\n\\nHowever, if it\\'s a single fact, then only that is extracted.\\n\\nAlso, avoid using any hashtags or emojis in the output, as they should be removed. But I think the input already doesn\\'t include them, so that\\'s handled.\\n\\nNow, putting this into practice with a sample post: \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" \\n\\nFirst, remove the exclamation points to make it more formal. Then, rephrase it without any personal pronouns or emotional words. So it becomes \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\"\\n\\nAnother example: \"I can\\'t believe how much waste there is in this system.\" The main claim would be \"Significant waste exists within the current system.\"\\n\\nWait, but according to the instructions, I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts. So if someone writes \"The park is beautiful today,\" it\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nBut what about a more complex sentence? Like \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the event has been postponed.\" The main claim would be that the event has been postponed due to circumstances, without adding anything else.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I don\\'t change any numerical values or names. So if a post mentions \"New York City\" or \"2023 data,\" those should remain as is.\\n\\nNow, considering all these points, I can start applying them to various social media posts.'\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post.

I should maintain the intended meaning, keep who, what, where, when, why as present, and avoid personal or subjective language.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll break down the post. The key points are about Tripti Desai converting to Christianity in 2013, being part of a conversion racket, and posing as a Hindu in disguise. The hashtags mention Sabarimala and JanamTV, which seem related to the expose.\\n\\nThe main claim here is that Tripti Desai converted to Christianity in 2013 and is involved in a conversion racket, pretending to be a Hindu. I should extract this information without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI need to remove any emotional or subjective language like \"truth out\" and \"beware.\" Also, the original phrasing can be kept as much as possible. The named entities like Tripti Desai, 2013, Sabarimala, JanamTV should remain unchanged.\\n\\nThe user also mentioned that if no changes are needed, return the original claim exactly. In this case, I think the main claim is clear enough without too many changes. However, I should check for any unnecessary words or filler to make it concise.\\n\\nSo, putting it together, the main claim would be: \"Tripti Desai converted to Christianity in 2013 and is involved in a conversion racket, posing as a Hindu.\" The hashtags can be included if necessary, but perhaps it\\'s better to keep it focused on the claim itself.\\n\\nI should ensure clarity and formality without using emotional language. Let me structure this sentence clearly: \"Tripti Desai converted to Christianity in 2013 and is linked to a conversion racket, operating under the guise of Hinduism.\"\\n\\nThat seems concise and captures all essential information without added emotion or extra details.'\n 'Alright, so I\\'m trying to help extract the main claim from this social media post.

Should that be included? It might be extra info, though. The main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add anything new, just extract what\\'s there.

Early treatments, like Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh and cases in Israel, are more successful than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also mentions that the Ivermectin story was previously reported on Gateway Pundit and links to more information. The main focus seems to be on Kirsch's arguments against vaccines and in favor of early treatments.\\n\\nI should extract only the most important claim.

However, his second point about early treatments being more successful also adds context but isn't as direct as the first claim.\\n\\nBut wait, looking at the instructions, if there are multiple facts, I should select the most important one. The main argument seems to center around vaccines being harmful and effective treatments existing. Maybe both points are important, but perhaps the primary claim is about the vaccines' harm.\\n\\nHowever, the post starts by mentioning Kirsch arguing that vaccines kill more people than they save, which is a strong statement.

Let\\'s read through it carefully.\\n\\nThe post starts by mentioning Steve Kirsch, who is the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, testifying before the FDA. He argues that vaccines kill more people than they save. Then he points out that early treatments are more successful than boosters, using examples from Israel and Uttar Pradesh, India, where Ivermectin is administered, leading to nearly no cases. There\\'s also a mention of a previous report on Gateway Pundit and a link for more info.\\n\\nI should focus only on the main claim. The key points here are Steve Kirsch testifying and his arguments: vaccines kill more than they save and early treatments (like Ivermectin) being more effective.\\n\\nWait, but the post also includes details about the meeting, like it\\'s an Open Public Hearing Session of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Should that be included? It might be extra info, though. The main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add anything new, just extract what\\'s there. So, the main claim would be about Steve Kirsch arguing that vaccines are more harmful than beneficial and supporting early treatments with examples.\\n\\nAlso, the post uses Gateway Pundit as a source for the Ivermectin story, but since it\\'s just referencing a previous report, maybe it doesn\\'t add to the main claim. The important part is the comparison between vaccines and early treatments.\\n\\nI should avoid emotional language or personal qualifiers, so remove phrases like \"more than they save\" if needed, but in this case, it\\'s part of his argument. Maintain the facts as given without adding any interpretations beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nSo, the main claim is Steve Kirsch arguing that vaccines kill more people than they save and highlighting early treatments\\' success with Ivermectin in India.\\n</think>\\n\\nSteve Kirsch, the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, testified before the FDA, arguing that vaccines kill more people than they save.

Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nThe post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He's the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The key points he made are:\\n\\n1. Vaccines kill more people than they save.\\n2. Early treatments, like Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh and cases in Israel, are more successful than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also mentions that the Ivermectin story was previously reported on Gateway Pundit and links to more information. The main focus seems to be on Kirsch's arguments against vaccines and in favor of early treatments.\\n\\nI should extract only the most important claim. Since the first point is about vaccines killing more people, which is a strong statement, that might be the primary claim. However, his second point about early treatments being more successful also adds context but isn't as direct as the first claim.\\n\\nBut wait, looking at the instructions, if there are multiple facts, I should select the most important one. The main argument seems to center around vaccines being harmful and effective treatments existing. Maybe both points are important, but perhaps the primary claim is about the vaccines' harm.\\n\\nHowever, the post starts by mentioning Kirsch arguing that vaccines kill more people than they save, which is a strong statement. Then he adds another point about early treatments being better, including specific examples.\\n\\nThe user instructions say to use only information from the post, no new facts, and maintain intended meaning even if incorrect. Also, to preserve important details like who, what, where, when, why, etc., but keep it clear and formal without emojis or hashtags.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the main claim is that vaccines kill more people than they save. Alternatively, it could be that early treatments are more successful, especially with Ivermectin in India and Israel.\\n\\nBut since Kirsch first makes the argument about vaccines, maybe that's the main claim. However, the post also includes information about early treatments which might need to be included if there are multiple facts.\\n\\nWait, no, the instructions say to select the most important one. The primary point seems to be that vaccines are more harmful than beneficial. Therefore, I think that should be the main claim extracted.\\n\\nSo, the main claim is Steve Kirsch's argument that vaccines kill more people than they save.\\n</think>\\n\\nSteve Kirsch argued that vaccines kill more people than they save during his testimony before the FDA.\"]",

So, the main claim here is that the medical industry is only offering free flu shots and is using incentives to encourage people to get them, while other important medications like EpiPens and insulin are not free.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don't add any new information or infer anything beyond what's in the post. I should stick strictly to the content provided. Also, I have to avoid emotional language and maintain a neutral tone. \\n\\nThe key elements here are who (the medical industry), what (they give away for free), where (implicitly, in their promotions), why (to encourage vaccinations). The specific examples given are EpiPens and insulin, which aren't free, so the main claim should highlight this contrast.\\n\\nI think the most important fact is that other life-saving items like EpiPens and insulin aren't free, while flu shots are promoted with incentives. So, the core of the post is this comparison and the critique of the industry's strategy.\\n\\nI should make sure to remove any redundant phrases or filler words without losing the original meaning. Also, since the language is already in English, I don't need to change anything unless there are specific instructions about that, but it seems straightforward here.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the main claim would state that the medical industry doesn't offer other essential medications for free and is using incentives for flu shots, which the author finds odd.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe medical industry provides essential medications like EpiPens and insulin without offers, while promoting flu shots with incentives such as gift cards. This approach is deemed unusual by the author.\"]",

So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nAlright, breaking this down: The main points here are about legislation changes being effective from April 27, 2020. It mentions looking up an act on the government website and notes that the updates went into effect recently.\\n\\nI need to extract only the main claim without adding any extra information. I should avoid using emotional language or personal pronouns, which aren\\'t present here anyway. The post uses some filler words like \"just\" and \"so,\" but I can remove those to make it clearer.\\n\\nThe key entities are the date (27th April 2020) and the legislation changes. I need to maintain the original phrasing as much as possible, so I should keep the structure of the statement intact without altering the facts.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the claim is neutral and factual, avoiding any subjective language. Since all the information is provided, I don\\'t have to infer anything else.\\n\\nSo, putting it together, the main claim is about the legislation changes coming into effect on April 27, 2020.'\n 'Okay, so I need to help extract the main claim from a social media post. The user has provided some instructions and an example.

I should avoid adding any new facts or context. Also, I need to maintain the intended meaning even if it\\'s factually incorrect, which is a bit tricky because I don\\'t want to change the facts but just extract them as they are.\\n\\nLooking at the example given: the original post talks about changes to legislation updated on April 27, 2020, and that it has come into force from that day. The extracted claim is \"Changes to legislation have been updated on the 27th April 2020 and came into effect on that day.\"\\n\\nSo, I need to break down the steps:\\n\\n1. Identify the main subject: here, it\\'s about changes to legislation.\\n2. Extract relevant details: when they were updated (April 27, 2020) and when they came into effect (same day).\\n3. Use formal language without emotional terms.\\n4. Preserve named entities as they are written.\\n5. Make sure to include who, what, where, when, why if present.\\n\\nWait, in the example, there\\'s no mention of \"who\" or \"why,\" so maybe I don\\'t need to include those unless they\\'re present.\\n\\nAnother point is to avoid adding any clarifications or new information, just extract based on the post. Also, remove filler words and maintain the original phrasing as much as possible. So, in this case, the post says \"changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020.\" I think the main facts are the what (changes), when (April 27, 2020), and that it came into force the same day.\\n\\nI should make sure not to include any personal or emotional language. The original post uses \"just to let you know,\" which is more conversational, so in the extracted claim, I\\'ll remove that and make it more formal.\\n\\nAlso, acronyms should be expanded unless part of an official name. In this case, there are none, so no changes needed there.\\n\\nIf there were multiple facts, I need to pick the most important one. Here, both the update date and the effective date seem important, so including both makes sense.\\n\\nFinally, keep the same language as the post but formalize it without emojis or hashtags.\\n\\nPutting this together, I think the extracted claim should clearly state that changes were made on April 27, 2020, and they came into effect that day. So the main points are the what (changes to legislation), when (April 27, 2020), and the effective date (same as update date).'\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post.

Also, I must preserve all named entities exactly as they are, so \"Equality Act 2010\" stays as is.\\n\\nLet me break down the post: it\\'s advising against challenging face covering guidelines because it can lead to personal liability under specific sections of the Equality Act. So the main claim is about potential legal consequences for non-compliance.\\n\\nI should structure this without any markdown, just plain text. Also, I need to make sure that if there are multiple facts, I pick the most important one. In this case, it\\'s the liability aspect tied to the Equality Act sections mentioned.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a handle on it. Now, I\\'ll extract the main claim accordingly.'\n 'Okay, so I need to extract the main claim from a given social media post. The instructions are pretty detailed, but let me try to break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post that talks about government advice regarding face coverings. It mentions not challenging people to wear face coverings because of legal reasons. Specifically, it mentions potential personal liability for employees and possible fines up to £5,000 under the Equality Act 2010, sections 112 and 119.\\n\\nI need to extract only the main claim from this post. The guidelines say to use only information from the post without adding any new facts or context. I should avoid filler words and maintain the original phrasing as much as possible. Also, I must keep the language formal and neutral, avoiding personal or emotional terms.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s clear that the main point is about legal repercussions for not following the advice. The key elements here are the potential liabilities and the specific sections of the Equality Act mentioned. So, the main claim should state that people may be personally liable if they defy the government\\'s advice on face coverings.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I don\\'t add any extra information or change the structure too much. The original post uses some filler like \"This is for GOOD REASON,\" but since we\\'re removing personal qualifiers, that part can go. The main facts are about liability and the specific legal sections, so those should be included.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the post incorrectly mentions section numbers as [sic], which I\\'ll have to preserve. Also, I should expand any acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, but \"Equality Act\" seems fine as is.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the main claim would clearly state the potential liability and reference the specific legal sections without adding or omitting anything extra.'\n \"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user is asking me to extract the main claim from a social media post. They provided an example input and some specific instructions on how I should handle it.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they want. It seems like they're looking for a tool or method to process text from posts on social media, extracting key information in a structured way. The example given is about a government advice regarding face coverings, and the output is a concise statement of the main claim.\\n\\nLooking at their instructions, it's quite detailed. They want me to use only the information from the post without adding any new facts. Also, I should avoid personal or emotional language and maintain a neutral tone. Oh, and I must keep the original phrasing as much as possible while removing filler words.\\n\\nSo, when processing the input, I need to identify the main claim, which in this case is about legal consequences for not wearing a face covering. The post mentions personal liability and specific sections of the Equality Act 2010. My task is to extract the essential details without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI should make sure to preserve named entities like the statute sections mentioned. Also, I need to expand any acronyms unless they're part of an official name. Numerical values should remain unchanged as well.\\n\\nWait, in their example response, they didn't include emojis or hashtags and removed quotes. So, in the output, I shouldn't add those either. The main claim is about liability under specific legal sections, so that's what needs to be highlighted.\\n\\nI think the key here is to parse the post carefully, identify the main assertion, and then present it clearly without any extra information. Also, ensure that the language remains formal and neutral, avoiding any subjective terms.\\n\\nSo, if I were given a new social media post, I would start by reading through it to understand the main point. Then, I'd extract the key elements like who, what, when, where, why—though not all might be present—and structure that into a concise statement. I have to make sure not to miss any important details and stick strictly to the information given.\\n\\nI also need to handle cases where there are multiple facts; in such scenarios, I should prioritize the most significant one. For example, if a post talks about both increased sales and a product recall, the main claim would probably be the sales increase since it's more positive or impactful.\\n\\nAnother thing is maintaining the original language. If the post uses colloquial terms, I shouldn't change them to formal ones unless necessary for clarity. But if the user wants a neutral tone, maybe some terms need to be adjusted slightly without losing the intended meaning.\\n\\nI should also be cautious about removing any filler words or unnecessary phrases while keeping the core message intact. For instance, in the example, they removed quotes and specific mentions of personal liability, but kept the legal sections.\\n\\nLastly, I must ensure that the output is only the final claim text without any additional explanations or formatting. So, after processing, the response should be a clean extract reflecting the main claim as per the instructions.\"]"

The user also mentions worry about Queensland's upcoming restrictions and groundwork being laid there.\\n\\nThen, the post shifts focus to a specific story about Mick Danks, an inmate at Sydney's Long Bay correctional centre. He's requesting an extension of his jail sentence to avoid lockdown measures, saying he prefers being locked up because it's less restrictive than being on the outside.\\n\\nThe main points are the concern over lockdowns and the story about Mick Danks seeking to stay in prison instead of dealing with lockdowns.\\n\\nI need to extract only the main claim.

There's also a mention of Queensland potentially implementing stricter measures. However, the more specific claim is about Mick Danks' situation.\\n\\nWait, but the user's first part talks about the lockdowns being ineffective, while the second part is about the prisoner avoiding lockdown by staying in jail. The main claims are both the lack of scientific basis and the prisoner's choice to remain incarcerated.\\n\\nSince the instructions say to select the most important claim if there are multiple facts, I should pick the primary one. The initial argument against lockdowns seems more central than the story about the prisoner, but perhaps the user is using the prisoner's situation as a point against the lockdowns.\\n\\nBut looking again, the post starts and ends with the same statement about Australia's sad state due to lockdowns, so maybe the main claim is that these measures are not based on science and fail. However, there's also a secondary point about Queensland's upcoming restrictions and the prisoner's situation.\\n\\nSince the user mentions both the ineffective nature of lockdowns and the prisoner's choice, but the first part is more developed, perhaps that's the main claim. Alternatively, the story about the prisoner might be the main focus as it's more unique and directly challenges the lockdown measures by showing an alternative where someone prefers confinement over restrictions.\\n\\nBut considering the structure, the post starts by talking about the failure of lockdowns, then shifts to the prisoner's request. The user is using both points to argue against the effectiveness and necessity of lockdowns. So the main claim might be that lockdowns lack basis in science and have failed, with the prisoner example supporting this.\\n\\nI think the primary claim is the one about the lack of scientific basis and failure of lockdowns.

         "['Alright, so I have this query where the user wants to extract a main claim from a social media post. The input is \"post: short social media text\", and there\\'s specific instructions they want me to follow.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the user is asking for. They provided an example with a post saying \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" and the expected output is \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" So, my task is to take the main claim from similar posts and process it accordingly.\\n\\nLooking at the instructions, I see several points. I must only use information from the post, no additions or inferrals. Maintain intended meaning even if incorrect. Keep details about who, what, where, when, why if present. Retain original phrasing, remove filler. Preserve named entities as written. Use formal, neutral language without hashtags or emojis. Remove personal or subjective qualifiers. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name. Keep numerical values unchanged. Select the most important fact if multiple. Same language as post. If no changes needed, return original.\\n\\nSo, applying this to the example: The post is a question about whether the BJP government will return in 2024. The extracted claim is a statement that they will. I notice that the user changed \"Will our\" to \"Our\", which makes it more assertive but still retains the same meaning. Also, the exclamation mark was removed for formality.\\n\\nI should consider if there are any other posts like this and how to handle varying structures. For example, a different post might use \"Looking forward to 2024 with BJP\" or something similar. The key is to extract the main claim without adding anything extra.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m using only the information from the post. No making up facts or context. So if someone says \"BJP will win in 2024\", that\\'s a different angle but still extracts the same main point.\\n\\nIn processing, I should remove any personal or emotional language. For instance, if a user writes \"My BJP government is the best,\" I would extract just \"BJP government.\" Also, maintaining neutrality is important to keep it factual.\\n\\nI wonder about handling acronyms. If someone refers to Bharatiya Janata Party as BJPF (a typo), should I correct it? According to instructions, expand acronyms unless part of an official name. So if \"BJP\" is correct, I shouldn\\'t change it. But if it\\'s a typo like \"Bhajp,\" maybe not. Hmm, need to be careful there.\\n\\nAnother point is numerical values. If the post mentions 2025 instead of 2024, should I adjust it? No, because I can\\'t infer facts; I must keep it as written unless instructed otherwise.\\n\\nI also need to choose the most important fact if multiple are present. So in a post like \"BJP government will return and bring prosperity,\" the main claim is about returning, not the prosperity part.\\n\\nFinally, output only the final claim without any extra info or formatting. So just the processed version of the main claim.'\n 'Okay, so I need to extract the main claim from a social media post. The input given is \"post: short social media text\", and there\\'s an example provided where \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" becomes \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" \\n\\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is being asked. It seems like the task is to take a short social media post, identify the main claim or statement, and then rephrase it in a clear, formal, and neutral tone without adding any extra information. The output should only be the extracted claim.\\n\\nLooking at the example, the original post uses an exclamation mark and some emotional language like \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\". The extracted version removes the exclamation points, keeps the main statement about the BJP government returning in 2024, but makes it more formal without adding any other words or changing the meaning.\\n\\nSo, for another example, if someone posts something like \"I can\\'t wait for the next Avengers movie!\", the main claim would be that an Avengers movie is expected, without the emotional exclamation and personal pronoun.\\n\\nAnother point to consider is removing filler words and maintaining important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, Why. In the example given, it\\'s about the BJP government returning in 2024, so those are the key elements.\\n\\nI also need to preserve named entities exactly as written. So if a post mentions \"Modi\" or another name, that should stay as is.\\n\\nAdditionally, I shouldn\\'t infer new facts but only use information from the post. That means no adding anything beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nExpanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since BJP is an acronym for a political party, it\\'s acceptable to keep it as is without expansion.\\n\\nMaintain numerical values unchanged and keep the same language as the post, avoiding any changes that alter the meaning or tone.\\n\\nSo, if I have a post like \"The new policy will help small businesses!\", the main claim would be \"A new policy aims to assist small businesses.\"\\n\\nAnother example: \"Our school is closing for winter break next week.\" becomes \"Our school will close for winter break next week.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure that any personal or emotional language is removed. For instance, \"I\\'m so happy the BJP won again!\" would become \"The BJP has won again.\"\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts in a post, I should select the most important one. So if someone writes \"The concert sold out and raised money for charity\", the main claim would be about both the concert selling out and raising funds.\\n\\nHowever, if it\\'s a single fact, then only that is extracted.\\n\\nAlso, avoid using any hashtags or emojis in the output, as they should be removed. But I think the input already doesn\\'t include them, so that\\'s handled.\\n\\nNow, putting this into practice with a sample post: \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" \\n\\nFirst, remove the exclamation points to make it more formal. Then, rephrase it without any personal pronouns or emotional words. So it becomes \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\"\\n\\nAnother example: \"I can\\'t believe how much waste there is in this system.\" The main claim would be \"Significant waste exists within the current system.\"\\n\\nWait, but according to the instructions, I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts. So if someone writes \"The park is beautiful today,\" it\\'s straightforward.\\n\\nBut what about a more complex sentence? Like \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the event has been postponed.\" The main claim would be that the event has been postponed due to circumstances, without adding anything else.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I don\\'t change any numerical values or names. So if a post mentions \"New York City\" or \"2023 data,\" those should remain as is.\\n\\nNow, considering all these points, I can start applying them to various social media posts.'\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. The input is \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read through the post carefully. It\\'s asking if the BJP government will come back in 2024. So the main point here is about the return of the BJP government, specifically in the next election year.\\n\\nI should make sure not to add any new information or infer anything beyond what\\'s stated. The user wants only the claim extracted using the information from the post. \\n\\nLooking at the instructions, I need to maintain the intended meaning, keep who, what, where, when, and why if present, and avoid adding or inferring facts. Also, remove filler like emojis, personal qualifiers, and maintain a neutral tone.\\n\\nIn this case, the claim is straightforward: it\\'s about the BJP government returning in 2024. I should keep the original phrasing as much as possible without changes unless necessary for clarity.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any need to expand acronyms here because \"BJP\" is likely an acronym already understood. Numerical values aren\\'t present, so that\\'s not a concern.\\n\\nSince there\\'s only one fact in the post, I just need to extract it clearly and formally. So, removing the exclamation mark for formality but keeping the main question.\\n\\nI should avoid using any emotional language or personal pronouns. The original has \"our,\" which is fine because it\\'s part of the claim without being subjective in a negative way.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the extracted claim would be: \"Will our BJP government return in 2024?\" This maintains the original intent, removes unnecessary elements, and presents it in a clear, formal manner.']"
