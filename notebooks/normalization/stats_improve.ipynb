Numerical values are kept as is.\\n\\nThe user instructions specify to use clear, formal, neutral language, remove filler, and preserve named entities if present. Here, no specific names are mentioned beyond \"CO2\" and \"greenhouse gases.\" The claim correctly states the percentage contribution and its insignificance.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m not making any changes unless necessary.

It also states a scientific fact that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases, making it an insignificant contributor to climate change.\\n\\nThe user wants the main claim extracted with specific instructions: use only info from the post, don\\'t add new facts, maintain intended meaning, neutral tone, clear and formal language, remove personal qualifiers, expand acronyms if necessary, keep numerical values unchanged, choose the most important fact if there are multiple, same language as post, and no changes if not needed.\\n\\nLooking at the claim provided: \"Human-generated CO2 is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" This is derived from the scientific fact mentioned in the post. It\\'s concise and captures the main assertion that CO2\\'s role is minimal.\\n\\nI need to ensure this meets all guidelines. The claim uses only info from the post, maintains the intended meaning, uses neutral language, and follows the structure without adding new facts. It correctly references the scientific fact presented. No changes in numerical values or acronyms are needed here since it directly cites the figure provided (0.1-0.2%).\\n\\nSo, this claim accurately reflects the main point of the post.'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim extracted from this social media post. Let me read through the post carefully first. The post starts with a critical tone about climate alarmists using numbers to deceive. It references a pie chart from the EPA showing CO2 at 82%. However, it points out that water vapor isn\\'t included as a greenhouse gas, making the chart misleading.\\n\\nThe post goes on to provide additional information: if water vapor is included, CO2\\'s role is much smaller. They mention that CO2 includes both natural and man-made sources, with specific numbers for nitrous oxide, methane, and others. There\\'s also a scientific fact stated that human-made CO2 contributes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nThe original claim provided by the user is: \"Human-generated CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" I need to make sure this meets all the extraction guidelines.\\n\\nFirst, using only information from the post. The key facts are that CO2 contributes 82%, but with water vapor excluded, which makes the chart deceptive. The real picture shows CO2\\'s contribution is much smaller when including water vapor. The scientific fact states that man-made CO2 is 0.1-0.2% of greenhouse gases and insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nI should check if I\\'m adding any new facts or inferring beyond what\\'s in the post. The claim accurately reflects the stated scientific fact, so no new information is added. It maintains the intended meaning about the minimal contribution of CO2. The language is formal and neutral without emotional terms. Numerical values are kept as is.\\n\\nThe user instructions specify to use clear, formal, neutral language, remove filler, and preserve named entities if present. Here, no specific names are mentioned beyond \"CO2\" and \"greenhouse gases.\" The claim correctly states the percentage contribution and its insignificance.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m not making any changes unless necessary. Since the claim is concise and directly taken from the post\\'s scientific fact, it seems appropriate without needing further alteration.\\n\\nFinally, I should output only the final claim text without additional info or formatting.']",

         "['Okay, I need to help the user refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. Let me read through the input carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the user provided a social media post and an initial claim. The task is to refine this claim based on specific instructions. \\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s about significant developments in South Africa where the military is taking control as the police are standing down. There\\'s a lot of details about emergency supplies and installing a specific app called Zello. The post also mentions hashtags related to freeing South Africa from the ANC government.\\n\\nThe initial claim is \"Army takes over from police to end unrest in South Africa.\" It seems like this captures the main event, but maybe it can be made more precise or accurate based on the post.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s instructions say not to add any new facts and maintain the intended meaning. Also, they want neutral language without emotional words.\\n\\nThe post mentions that the military is taking over from the SAPS (South Africa Police Services). So perhaps the claim should include both organizations. The initial claim only mentions the police, so maybe it\\'s better to name both the police and the army for clarity.\\n\\nAlso, the reason why they\\'re taking over isn\\'t explicitly stated in the post beyond controlling unrest. However, the user emphasizes not adding new facts, so I shouldn\\'t infer that.\\n\\nI should check if there are any personal or emotional words in the initial claim. The word \"end\" is neutral, but perhaps specifying whether it\\'s to restore order would be better, though again, without inferring.\\n\\nThe original instruction says to remove filler and maintain phrasing as much as possible. The initial claim is already concise, so maybe minor tweaks can improve it without changing meaning.\\n\\nConsidering all this, the revised claim should mention both SAPS and the army. So instead of \"from police,\" it\\'s \"from the South Africa Police Services (SAPS)\" to make it more precise.\\n\\nAlso, adding that the military is taking control aligns with the post\\'s content about the National Defence force deploying.\\n\\nSo the refined claim would be: \"South African Army takes control from SAPS as National Defence Force steps in during unrest.\"\\n\\nI should ensure this stays formal and neutral, removing any emotional language. It looks like I\\'m not adding new info; just clarifying with both entities mentioned.'\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post mentions an UPDATE about South Africa, specifically that the Military is taking control. The SAPS (South Africa Police Services) are standing down, and the National Defence Force is taking over. Red Falcons are deployed, and local security companies are on standby to assist the defence force. All citizens are told to remain indoors and not leave their houses.\\n\\nThere\\'s a section about emergency supplies, suggesting people stockpile essentials like bottled water, charged tele-communication equipment, and food for at least 10 days. They recommend installing Zello, a walkie-talkie app, for communication. The post also includes a hashtag about freeing South Africa from the ANC government and a call to #BreakTheSilenceAboutSouthAfrica.\\n\\nLooking at the claim provided: \"South African Army takes control from South Africa Police Services (SAPS) as National Defence Force steps in during unrest.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure I\\'m only using info from the post. The key elements are the military taking over, SAPS standing down, and NDF involved. The original claim captures this accurately.\\n\\nI should check if any changes are needed. It seems the claim is concise, uses the correct entities (South African Army, SAPS), and includes who is stepping in (National Defence Force). It doesn\\'t add new facts or infer anything beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any emotional language here; it\\'s factual. The structure is clear: who (Army) takes control from whom (SAPS), and what\\'s happening (NDF steps in during unrest).\\n\\nSo, the claim seems correct as it is.']"

It also states a scientific fact that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases, making it an insignificant contributor to climate change.\\n\\nThe user wants the main claim extracted with specific instructions: use only info from the post, don\\'t add new facts, maintain intended meaning, neutral tone, clear and formal language, remove personal qualifiers, expand acronyms if necessary, keep numerical values unchanged, choose the most important fact if there are multiple, same language as post, and no changes if not needed.\\n\\nLooking at the claim provided: \"Human-generated CO2 is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" This is derived from the scientific fact mentioned in the post. It\\'s concise and captures the main assertion that CO2\\'s role is minimal.\\n\\nI need to ensure this meets all guidelines. The claim uses only info from the post, maintains the intended meaning, uses neutral language, and follows the structure without adding new facts. It correctly references the scientific fact presented. No changes in numerical values or acronyms are needed here since it directly cites the figure provided (0.1-0.2%).\\n\\nSo, this claim accurately reflects the main point of the post.'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim extracted from this social media post. Let me read through the post carefully first. The post starts with a critical tone about climate alarmists using numbers to deceive. It references a pie chart from the EPA showing CO2 at 82%. However, it points out that water vapor isn\\'t included as a greenhouse gas, making the chart misleading.\\n\\nThe post goes on to provide additional information: if water vapor is included, CO2\\'s role is much smaller. They mention that CO2 includes both natural and man-made sources, with specific numbers for nitrous oxide, methane, and others. There\\'s also a scientific fact stated that human-made CO2 contributes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nThe original claim provided by the user is: \"Human-generated CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" I need to make sure this meets all the extraction guidelines.\\n\\nFirst, using only information from the post. The key facts are that CO2 contributes 82%, but with water vapor excluded, which makes the chart deceptive. The real picture shows CO2\\'s contribution is much smaller when including water vapor. The scientific fact states that man-made CO2 is 0.1-0.2% of greenhouse gases and insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nI should check if I\\'m adding any new facts or inferring beyond what\\'s in the post. The claim accurately reflects the stated scientific fact, so no new information is added. It maintains the intended meaning about the minimal contribution of CO2. The language is formal and neutral without emotional terms. Numerical values are kept as is.\\n\\nThe user instructions specify to use clear, formal, neutral language, remove filler, and preserve named entities if present. Here, no specific names are mentioned beyond \"CO2\" and \"greenhouse gases.\" The claim correctly states the percentage contribution and its insignificance.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m not making any changes unless necessary. Since the claim is concise and directly taken from the post\\'s scientific fact, it seems appropriate without needing further alteration.\\n\\nFinally, I should output only the final claim text without additional info or formatting.']"

However, \"admits\" is already formal enough.\\n\\nAlso, the post doesn\\'t mention anything about the pandemic\\'s start details, so including \"before the pandemic started\" is correct as per the user\\'s instructions.\\n\\nSo maybe the claim can be tightened by removing unnecessary words like \"The claim:\\xa0\" and \"before pandemic.\" Also, making sure it\\'s concise.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the revised claim should be: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nBut wait, the original post uses all caps for \"URGENT,\" but since the claim is supposed to be neutral and factual, maybe that\\'s not needed. Also, the user wants to remove filler, so I should avoid any unnecessary words.\\n\\nI think the final version can be: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nYes, that captures all the necessary information without adding anything extra. It uses only the facts from the post and maintains a formal tone.'\n 'Okay, I need to help the user refine the main claim from their social media post. Let me read through their instructions carefully.\\n\\nFirst, they provided a post and an initial claim. The goal is to extract the main factual assertion accurately without adding any new information. I should make sure not to infer anything beyond what\\'s in the post.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it says that Moderna\\'s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, admitted that the company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started. The claim they provided seems to capture this accurately: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nI need to check if any changes are necessary based on their instructions. They want only information from the post, neutral and factual language without personal or emotional words. The claim seems neutral.\\n\\nThey also mentioned keeping the same structure and language as the post. So I don\\'t need to change anything here unless there\\'s a specific issue like filler words. Let me read through again. \"produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses\" is clear and concise.\\n\\nNo changes seem necessary. The claim is accurate and meets all the required criteria.']"

Let me read through the input carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the user provided a social media post and an initial claim. The task is to refine this claim based on specific instructions. \\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s about significant developments in South Africa where the military is taking control as the police are standing down. There\\'s a lot of details about emergency supplies and installing a specific app called Zello. The post also mentions hashtags related to freeing South Africa from the ANC government.\\n\\nThe initial claim is \"Army takes over from police to end unrest in South Africa.\" It seems like this captures the main event, but maybe it can be made more precise or accurate based on the post.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s instructions say not to add any new facts and maintain the intended meaning. Also, they want neutral language without emotional words.\\n\\nThe post mentions that the military is taking over from the SAPS (South Africa Police Services). So perhaps the claim should include both organizations. The initial claim only mentions the police, so maybe it\\'s better to name both the police and the army for clarity.\\n\\nAlso, the reason why they\\'re taking over isn\\'t explicitly stated in the post beyond controlling unrest. However, the user emphasizes not adding new facts, so I shouldn\\'t infer that.\\n\\nI should check if there are any personal or emotional words in the initial claim. The word \"end\" is neutral, but perhaps specifying whether it\\'s to restore order would be better, though again, without inferring.\\n\\nThe original instruction says to remove filler and maintain phrasing as much as possible. The initial claim is already concise, so maybe minor tweaks can improve it without changing meaning.\\n\\nConsidering all this, the revised claim should mention both SAPS and the army. So instead of \"from police,\" it\\'s \"from the South Africa Police Services (SAPS)\" to make it more precise.\\n\\nAlso, adding that the military is taking control aligns with the post\\'s content about the National Defence force deploying.\\n\\nSo the refined claim would be: \"South African Army takes control from SAPS as National Defence Force steps in during unrest.\"\\n\\nI should ensure this stays formal and neutral, removing any emotional language. It looks like I\\'m not adding new info; just clarifying with both entities mentioned.'\n",
       " 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post mentions an UPDATE about South Africa, specifically that the Military is taking control. The SAPS (South Africa Police Services) are standing down, and the National Defence Force is taking over. Red Falcons are deployed, and local security companies are on standby to assist the defence force. All citizens are told to remain indoors and not leave their houses.\\n\\nThere\\'s a section about emergency supplies, suggesting people stockpile essentials like bottled water, charged tele-communication equipment, and food for at least 10 days. They recommend installing Zello, a walkie-talkie app, for communication. The post also includes a hashtag about freeing South Africa from the ANC government and a call to #BreakTheSilenceAboutSouthAfrica.\\n\\nLooking at the claim provided: \"South African Army takes control from South Africa Police Services (SAPS) as National Defence Force steps in during unrest.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure I\\'m only using info from the post. The key elements are the military taking over, SAPS standing down, and NDF involved. The original claim captures this accurately.\\n\\nI should check if any changes are needed. It seems the claim is concise, uses the correct entities (South African Army, SAPS), and includes who is stepping in (National Defence Force). It doesn\\'t add new facts or infer anything beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any emotional language here; it\\'s factual. The structure is clear: who (Army) takes control from whom (SAPS), and what\\'s happening (NDF steps in during unrest).\\n\\nSo, the claim seems correct as it is.']</td>\n",

The initial claim has these but is a bit informal with \"Got.\"\\n\\nI need to make it more formal without adding any extra info. So, replacing \"Got\" with \"has been awarded\" seems appropriate. Also, since the post specifies it\\'s recent, I can mention that it was recently awarded.\\n\\nSo, the refined claim would be: Tezpur Litchis have been awarded a GI tag recently.'\n",

The original claim is already concise, but perhaps making it slightly more neutral by removing \"recently\" might be better. Alternatively, keeping it as is could still work if it\\'s considered factual without being subjective.\\n\\nAfter evaluating, I think keeping the original claim as \"Tezpur Litchis have been awarded a GI tag recently\" is appropriate because it accurately reflects the post\\'s content while maintaining a neutral tone.']</td>\n",

The user provided a post that discusses how climate alarmists use numbers to deceive by omitting water vapor in the EPA\\'s pie chart, thereby exaggerating CO2\\'s role. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read through the post carefully. It starts by talking about the EPA\\'s pie chart showing CO2 at 82%, but it doesn\\'t mention that it only includes man-made greenhouse gases and excludes water vapor. By excluding water vapor, the chart makes CO2 seem more significant than it actually is.\\n\\nThe post then goes into detail about including water vapor to show that CO2\\'s role is much smaller. It lists the percentages: Nitrous Oxide at 6%, Methane at 9%, CO2 at 82%, Fluorinated Gases at 3%, and mentions greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It also states a scientific fact that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases, making it an insignificant contributor to climate change.\\n\\nThe user wants the main claim extracted with specific instructions: use only info from the post, don\\'t add new facts, maintain intended meaning, neutral tone, clear and formal language, remove personal qualifiers, expand acronyms if necessary, keep numerical values unchanged, choose the most important fact if there are multiple, same language as post, and no changes if not needed.\\n\\nLooking at the claim provided: \"Human-generated CO2 is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" This is derived from the scientific fact mentioned in the post. It\\'s concise and captures the main assertion that CO2\\'s role is minimal.\\n\\nI need to ensure this meets all guidelines. The claim uses only info from the post, maintains the intended meaning, uses neutral language, and follows the structure without adding new facts. It correctly references the scientific fact presented. No changes in numerical values or acronyms are needed here since it directly cites the figure provided (0.1-0.2%).\\n\\nSo, this claim accurately reflects the main point of the post.'\n",
       " 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim extracted from this social media post. Let me read through the post carefully first.

They mention that CO2 includes both natural and man-made sources, with specific numbers for nitrous oxide, methane, and others. There\\'s also a scientific fact stated that human-made CO2 contributes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nThe original claim provided by the user is: \"Human-generated CO2 constitutes only 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases and is an insignificant contributor to climate change.\" I need to make sure this meets all the extraction guidelines.\\n\\nFirst, using only information from the post. The key facts are that CO2 contributes 82%, but with water vapor excluded, which makes the chart deceptive. The real picture shows CO2\\'s contribution is much smaller when including water vapor. The scientific fact states that man-made CO2 is 0.1-0.2% of greenhouse gases and insignificant in climate impact.\\n\\nI should check if I\\'m adding any new facts or inferring beyond what\\'s in the post. The claim accurately reflects the stated scientific fact, so no new information is added. It maintains the intended meaning about the minimal contribution of CO2.

Numerical values are kept as is.\\n\\nThe user instructions specify to use clear, formal, neutral language, remove filler, and preserve named entities if present. Here, no specific names are mentioned beyond \"CO2\" and \"greenhouse gases.\" The claim correctly states the percentage contribution and its insignificance.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I\\'m not making any changes unless necessary.

The claim is currently \"Bananas are radioactive.\" But wait, does that make sense? I know bananas aren\\'t actually radioactive. So maybe this is a joke or a meme.\\n\\nLooking at the instructions, I should use only info from the post, no adding facts. Keep the original phrasing if possible. Remove filler like \"Interesting science facts.....\" and handle the hashtags. The user wants the claim to be clear and factual, but neutral. Also, avoid emotional words.\\n\\nThe post uses multiple bananas in emojis and mentions a banana tree, along with the word \"radioactive.\" So maybe the claim is saying that bananas are radioactive because of the tree or something? But I don\\'t think bananas themselves are radioactive.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the context is that the banana tree or its fruit has some radioactive property. Or maybe it\\'s part of a meme where the banana is used humorously in a sci-fi scenario.\\n\\nI need to extract the main claim without adding facts. The original claim was \"Bananas are radioactive,\" but that\\'s not correct. However, according to instructions, I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts. So I have to stick with what\\'s given.\\n\\nThe post mentions #banantree and #radioactive. Maybe the main claim is about bananas in relation to a radioactive tree? Or perhaps it\\'s implying something else through those hashtags.\\n\\nBut without more context, it\\'s hard to tell. The user wants the main factual assertion. Since the original claim is \"Bananas are radioactive,\" but that\\'s incorrect, I might need to reconsider. But according to instructions, I shouldn\\'t add new facts, so maybe I have to keep it as is despite its factual inaccuracies.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the main point is about the banana tree being related to radioactivity, not the bananas themselves. So perhaps the claim should be \"A banana tree has radioactive properties,\" but that\\'s inferring. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, the post uses both #banana and #radioactive. Maybe it\\'s a meme where the banana is depicted as something from a nuclear accident or something like that. But without more context, it\\'s hard to know.\\n\\nI think the safest approach is to take the main entity mentioned, which is bananas, and link it with the hashtag #radioactive.

Let me look at the input first.\\n\\nThe post says: \"This is what you breathe in when you wear a mask. Wearing This is bacteria grown in a petri dish from a swab taken from the inside of a mask after 20 minutes of use.\"\\n\\nWait, that seems repetitive. The user probably meant to say that wearing a mask results in breathing in bacteria from a petri dish, which was taken from inside the mask after 20 minutes.\\n\\nThe initial claim is \"Petri dish shows bacteria from a mask after being worn for 20 minutes.\" That\\'s good because it captures the main fact: there\\'s bacteria in a petri dish from a mask used for 20 minutes.\\n\\nI need to ensure I\\'m only using info from the post and maintaining a neutral tone. The claim is factual without adding any personal or emotional language. Also, keeping numerical details like \"20 minutes\" is important. No acronyms here unless they\\'re part of an official name, which isn\\'t the case.\\n\\nIs there any unnecessary filler in the claim? Let me check. \"Petri dish shows bacteria from a mask after being worn for 20 minutes.\" It seems concise and clear. Maybe I can make it more formal by replacing \"shows\" with \"contains,\" but that might not be necessary. The current version is already pretty straightforward.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any subjective words or personal pronouns, so the tone stays neutral. Also, all named entities like \"petri dish\" and \"mask\" are correctly used without alteration.\\n\\nIs there a more important fact? The primary point is the presence of bacteria in the mask after 20 minutes, which is what the claim states. There\\'s no other major factual assertion in the post beyond that.\\n\\nSo, I think the initial claim is appropriate. It captures the key details: the source (petri dish), where it came from (inside the mask), and the time frame (20 minutes). No changes are needed unless there\\'s a specific instruction to do so, which isn\\'t the case here.']</td>\n",

Let me start by reading through their input carefully.\\n\\nThe original post says: \"URGENT – Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel Admits Company Produced 100,000 COVID-19 Vaccine Doses In 2019 Before The Pandemic Started.\"\\n\\nThe current claim is: \"The claim: Moderna CEO admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses before pandemic.\"\\n\\nHmm, the user wants to refine this. Let me check the instructions they provided. They want only information from the post, minimal clarification allowed, no adding new facts, maintain intended meaning even if incorrect, include details about Who, What, Where, When, Why if present, retain original phrasing where possible, remove filler, preserve named entities exactly as written, use clear and formal language, avoid personal or subjective terms, expand acronyms unless part of official name, keep numerical values unchanged, select the most important fact if multiple, stay in same language, and only output final claim without extra info.\\n\\nLooking at the original post again. The key points are Moderna\\'s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, admitting that they produced 100,000 doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\\n\\nThe current claim is a bit wordy. It says \"admits company produced...doses\" but maybe \"disclosed\" sounds better than \"admits.\" Also, perhaps removing \"the\" at the beginning makes it cleaner.\\n\\nWait, the user wants to use only info from the post and maintain original phrasing. So I shouldn\\'t change \\'admits\\' to \\'disclosed.\\' But perhaps using a more formal term could be better. However, \"admits\" is already formal enough.\\n\\nAlso, the post doesn\\'t mention anything about the pandemic\\'s start details, so including \"before the pandemic started\" is correct as per the user\\'s instructions.\\n\\nSo maybe the claim can be tightened by removing unnecessary words like \"The claim:\\xa0\" and \"before pandemic.\" Also, making sure it\\'s concise.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the revised claim should be: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nBut wait, the original post uses all caps for \"URGENT,\" but since the claim is supposed to be neutral and factual, maybe that\\'s not needed. Also, the user wants to remove filler, so I should avoid any unnecessary words.\\n\\nI think the final version can be: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nYes, that captures all the necessary information without adding anything extra. It uses only the facts from the post and maintains a formal tone.'\n",
       " 'Okay, I need to help the user refine the main claim from their social media post. Let me read through their instructions carefully.\\n\\nFirst, they provided a post and an initial claim. The goal is to extract the main factual assertion accurately without adding any new information. I should make sure not to infer anything beyond what\\'s in the post.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it says that Moderna\\'s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, admitted that the company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started. The claim they provided seems to capture this accurately: \"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel admits company produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic started.\"\\n\\nI need to check if any changes are necessary based on their instructions. They want only information from the post, neutral and factual language without personal or emotional words. The claim seems neutral.\\n\\nThey also mentioned keeping the same structure and language as the post. So I don\\'t need to change anything here unless there\\'s a specific issue like filler words. Let me read through again. \"produced 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses\" is clear and concise.\\n\\nNo changes seem necessary. The claim is accurate and meets all the required criteria.']</td>\n",
