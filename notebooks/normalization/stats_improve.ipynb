The post doesn\\'t specify that there are multiple participants or if this is a general observation, so maybe starting with \"A\" is fine as it\\'s the only information given.\\n\\nThe second part says the event happens once in a century. I think \"once-in-a-century\" is an astronomical alignment, so that should be included to show the cause or context.\\n\\nI also need to ensure clarity and formality while removing any filler or subjective language. The original claim uses commas which might make it a bit choppy, but keeping it concise is important.\\n\\nLet me check if I\\'m maintaining all the required elements: who (Sikh participant), what (no mustache), where (Delhi farmers protest), when (once in a century alignment). That seems covered.\\n\\nI should also make sure not to add any personal or emotional language. The original post didn\\'t use any, so that\\'s good.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together: \"A Sikh participant in the Delhi farmers\\' protest has been observed without a mustache, coinciding with once-in-a-century astronomical alignments.\" \\n\\nI think this captures both points accurately and stays neutral.

The user provided an example where they took a long post about legal repercussions and condensed it into a concise statement. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read through the post carefully. It mentions that not following government advice on wearing face coverings could lead to personal liability and fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010. There\\'s also mention of potential discrimination claims leading to compensation payments, but the main threat seems to be about individual liability.\\n\\nI should focus only on information from the post without adding anything extra. I\\'ll remove any emotional language like \"good reason\" and stick to facts. The key elements are who might be liable (individuals), what happens (fines up to £5k), why (under section 112 of Equality Act 2010).\\n\\nI need to keep the original phrasing as much as possible but make it concise. So, instead of \"my\" or other personal pronouns, I\\'ll use formal language. Also, make sure not to include any filler words.\\n\\nThe example given by the user is clear and formal. It includes who (individuals), what (fines), where (Equality Act 2010), and why (defying advice). So, I should follow a similar structure but ensure it\\'s in one concise sentence without unnecessary details about compensation since that wasn\\'t the primary threat mentioned.\\n\\nWait, in the original post, there are two parts: liability for offences under section 112 leading to fines and potential discrimination claims under section 119. But since the main advice is about not challenging the face covering rule, the primary issue is the first part about personal liability and fines.\\n\\nI should make sure not to include the second part unless it\\'s crucial. The example focused only on the fine part. So, I\\'ll structure the claim around that without mentioning the compensation.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the claim should clearly state that individuals may be liable for fines up to £5k under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010 for defying government advice on face coverings.\\n</think>\\n\\nPeople may face personal liability and potential fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010 for defying government advice on wearing face coverings.']",

So I\\'ll rephrase each point without adding any extra information or correcting facts based on the user\\'s instruction not to infer new things.\\n\\nI should avoid personal qualifiers like \"my\" or \"their\" unless necessary for clarity. Also, check if any acronyms need expansion. In this case, it doesn\\'t seem necessary as they are part of proper nouns.\\n\\nFinally, structure the claim to include all these points clearly and succinctly.'\n 'Okay, I\\'m looking at this social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket. The main point here is the use of technology in his casket. So, first, I need to extract the main claim from the post.\\n\\nThe post mentions that the casket is worth $17 billion and has been computerized. This allows family members to watch his remains through their phones after he\\'s buried. It also talks about how the technology will keep his remains preserved for ten years, supplied by London Casket makers. \\n\\nI need to make sure I only use information from the post without adding anything extra. The claim should be concise and stick to the facts given. So, starting with the casket\\'s value and the fact that it has monitoring technology.\\n\\nI should avoid any personal or emotional language. Words like \"family can watch his remains\" need to stay as they are but make sure the sentence is clear and formal. Also, I shouldn\\'t include extra details about how the system works unless it\\'s crucial for the main point.\\n\\nThe post repeats some information, so I can consolidate that into a single statement without losing the essential facts. The key elements are who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket with technology), where (supplied by London casket makers), when (after interment) and why (preservation).\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim doesn\\'t have any filler words or emotional qualifiers.

         "['<think>\\nOkay, I\\'m looking at this task where I need to refine a main claim extracted from a social media post.

For instance, \"Steve Kirsch also pointed out that early treatments...\" repeats similar ideas. I might need to streamline this to avoid redundancy while keeping all essential points.\\n\\nI should ensure that numerical values are kept as is, but here it\\'s about case numbers, so no specific figures are needed unless they were mentioned.

It also notes the Ivermectin story was reported on Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nBut the user might want it even shorter, removing some repeating information or perhaps trimming down the description of his points for brevity without losing essential details.\\n\\nI think the initial claim is solid.

It also includes the location (Uttar Pradesh) and references the source (Gateway Pundit). \\n\\nIs there anything else? The post mentions that this was part of a hearing, specifically the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s open session. Maybe including that could add more context, but it might make the claim longer.\\n\\nI should stick to the facts presented without adding any inferences.

Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. From what I gather, he\\'s arguing against vaccines, saying they might kill more people than they save. That seems like a strong statement, so that should be the main point.\\n\\nHe also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing to Israel and Uttar Pradesh in India where Ivermectin is used. Cases there are nearly non-existent now, which supports his claim about early treatments working better than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also talks about this hearing being part of a larger meeting by the FDA, specifically mentioning the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s Open Public Hearing Session. There are some official terms like CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) which might add context, but I think they can be omitted since the main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new facts or entities beyond what\\'s in the post. So no introducing data or figures not already mentioned. Also, I have to maintain a neutral tone without adding personal or emotional language. Words like \"my\" or \"beloved\" shouldn\\'t be there.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim: it mentions Steve Kirsch testifying, arguing vaccines kill more than they save, and highlighting early treatments with Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh. The refined version should keep all that but make it concise. Maybe remove some redundant phrases like \"was up next to testify\" as it\\'s already covered.\\n\\nI also notice there\\'s a lot of repetition in the post about following on bio links and mentions of Jim Hoft. Those can be trimmed to keep the main claim clean. The structure needs to flow logically: who, what, where, when, why. So starting with Steve Kirsch, his role, testifying before FDA, his argument against vaccines, supporting it with examples from Israel and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nI should avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since \"FDA\" is already clear, maybe just keep it as is without expansion. Also, numerical values aren\\'t mentioned here, so no changes needed there.\\n\\nIf multiple facts are present, I need to pick the most important one. The main point seems to be Kirsch\\'s argument about vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial, supported by treatment success stories.\\n\\nThe language should stay formal and clear, matching the social media post\\'s tone but without any filler words. Remove any emotional terms like \"brave\" or \"evil,\" which aren\\'t present here, so that shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the refined claim captures Steve Kirsch\\'s testimony, his stance on vaccines, and the evidence he uses about early treatments.

He highlighted the success of early treatments like Ivermectin, which has nearly eliminated cases in Uttar Pradesh, India.'\n '<think>\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. From what I gather, he\\'s arguing against vaccines, saying they might kill more people than they save. That seems like a strong statement, so that should be the main point.\\n\\nHe also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing to Israel and Uttar Pradesh in India where Ivermectin is used. Cases there are nearly non-existent now, which supports his claim about early treatments working better than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also talks about this hearing being part of a larger meeting by the FDA, specifically mentioning the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s Open Public Hearing Session. There are some official terms like CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) which might add context, but I think they can be omitted since the main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new facts or entities beyond what\\'s in the post. So no introducing data or figures not already mentioned. Also, I have to maintain a neutral tone without adding personal or emotional language. Words like \"my\" or \"beloved\" shouldn\\'t be there.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim: it mentions Steve Kirsch testifying, arguing vaccines kill more than they save, and highlighting early treatments with Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh. The refined version should keep all that but make it concise. Maybe remove some redundant phrases like \"was up next to testify\" as it\\'s already covered.\\n\\nI also notice there\\'s a lot of repetition in the post about following on bio links and mentions of Jim Hoft. Those can be trimmed to keep the main claim clean. The structure needs to flow logically: who, what, where, when, why. So starting with Steve Kirsch, his role, testifying before FDA, his argument against vaccines, supporting it with examples from Israel and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nI should avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since \"FDA\" is already clear, maybe just keep it as is without expansion. Also, numerical values aren\\'t mentioned here, so no changes needed there.\\n\\nIf multiple facts are present, I need to pick the most important one. The main point seems to be Kirsch\\'s argument about vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial, supported by treatment success stories.\\n\\nThe language should stay formal and clear, matching the social media post\\'s tone but without any filler words. Remove any emotional terms like \"brave\" or \"evil,\" which aren\\'t present here, so that shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the refined claim captures Steve Kirsch\\'s testimony, his stance on vaccines, and the evidence he uses about early treatments. It stays factual without adding anything extra.\\n</think>\\n\\nSteve Kirsch, the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, testified before the FDA, arguing that vaccines may kill more people than they save.

         "['Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. The user provided an example where they took a short text from a post and turned it into a concise statement.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The goal is to extract the main factual assertion from the post without adding any new information. Also, I must maintain the original meaning even if there are factual errors. That\\'s important because the user doesn\\'t want me to fact-check or add my own interpretations.\\n\\nLooking at the example given:\\n\\npost: \"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nclaim: \"Changes to legislation have been updated on April 27, 2020, and are now in effect.\"\\n\\nI notice that the claim removed some filler words like \"just to let you know,\" \"so\" and \"therefore.\" It also kept the key points: what (changes to legislation), when (April 27, 2020), and the action taken (come into force, applicable from now).\\n\\nSo, applying this to another example. Let\\'s say a post says, \"The park will be closed for maintenance this weekend. The closure starts tomorrow and ends on Monday.\" I need to extract the main claim.\\n\\nFirst, identify who, what, when, where, why if possible. In this case, it\\'s about the park closing, starting tomorrow, ending Monday.\\n\\nSo, the main facts are: The park is closed for maintenance, closure starts tomorrow, ends Monday.\\n\\nPutting that into a concise statement without filler would be \"The park will be closed for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday.\"\\n\\nI should make sure to remove any personal or emotional words. Also, check if any acronyms need expanding unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nAlso, keep the language clear and formal but don\\'t add anything not in the post. So, no \"it\\'s important to know\" or similar phrases.\\n\\nAnother example: \"My favorite café is opening a new branch next month! I\\'m so excited!\" Here, the main fact is about the café opening a new branch next month.\\n\\nSo the claim would be \"A new café branch is set to open next month.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure not to include the emotional part like \"I\\'m so excited\" and just stick to the facts: who (the café), what (new branch), when (next month).\\n\\nNow, considering all these steps, I can see how to approach refining any given claim.'\n 'Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a task where they need to refine a main claim extracted from a social media post. They\\'ve given an example with specific instructions on what to do.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the input carefully. The post is about legislation changes on April 27, 2020, becoming effective that day. The original claim says something about the park closing for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday, which doesn\\'t align with the post\\'s content.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the refined claim only uses information from the post and maintains a neutral tone without adding new facts. I should remove any emotional language or personal pronouns. Also, I should keep the original phrasing as much as possible while being clear and formal.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they took the post\\'s date and legislation update to create a concise claim. So, in this case, since there\\'s no mention of a park closure but rather legislative changes, the correct approach is to focus on that aspect.\\n\\nI should make sure not to infer anything extra. The user wants minimal clarification if possible. So, the refined claim should stick strictly to what\\'s stated without adding any assumptions about why it\\'s important or how it affects users beyond what\\'s mentioned.\\n\\nAlso, I need to keep the language clear and formal, avoiding any subjective terms. For example, instead of saying \"I just wanted to share this update,\" I should state facts directly.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll extract the key dates and focus on the legislation change without adding any extra information or emotional language.'\n None\n 'Alright, let\\'s tackle this step by step. The user has provided a social media post and an example of how the main claim was extracted from it. My task is to follow the instructions and extract the main claim accurately.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the post carefully:\\n\\n\"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nBreaking down the post:\\n\\n- The user is informing others about a legislative update.\\n- The act was updated on April 27, 2020.\\n- It came into effect on that same day.\\n- It\\'s applicable starting from that day.\\n\\nNow, I need to extract the main claim. The key facts here are the date of the update and when it became effective. The post mentions both, but perhaps the more important point is when it came into force because that indicates its current applicability.\\n\\nIn the example provided, the claim was: \"The legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\"\\n\\nThis captures the main point succinctly.\\n\\nSo applying similar logic to another hypothetical post:\\n\\n\" Residents are reminded that the local ordinance regarding trash collection now requires all households to separate recyclables and compostables by Friday. The new rule takes effect this week.\"\\n\\nMain facts: \\n- New local ordinance about trash collection.\\n- Requirement for separating materials by a specific date (Friday).\\n- Effective this week.\\n\\nThe main claim would highlight when it starts (this week) and the requirement (separating recyclables and compostables). So, \"A new trash separation requirement is effective this week.\"\\n\\nThis keeps it clear and captures both who (residents), what (new rule), and when (this week).\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"A major highway closure is set to begin next Monday due to construction. Drivers are advised to plan alternative routes.\\n\\nMain facts:\\n- Highway closure starting next Monday.\\n- Reason: Construction.\\n- Impact: Drivers should take alternate routes.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A significant highway closure begins on Monday for construction, urging drivers to use alternative routes.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (drivers), what (closure), when (Monday), and why (construction).\\n\\nIn cases where there are multiple facts but one is more prominent, focus on the key action or event. For instance, in a post about both a new law and its effective date, the main claim would likely be about the law taking effect.\\n\\nSo if the post says: \"A new environmental regulation was enacted this month, mandating reduced emissions by large factories starting next year.\"\\n\\nThe main facts are:\\n- New regulation.\\n- Enacted this month.\\n- Mandates reduced emissions.\\n- Effective next year.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A new environmental regulation requiring reduced emissions from large factories begins next year.\"\\n\\nThis includes the new regulation, its enactment date, and its target.\\n\\nAnother aspect is to avoid adding any personal or emotional language. For example, instead of saying \"This is a big change,\" it\\'s better to state facts without judgment.\\n\\nNow, considering all this, if I have a post that says: \"The library will be closed tomorrow for renovations. Patrons are advised to plan accordingly.\"\\n\\nThe main claim would focus on the closure and its reason. So, \"The library is closed tomorrow for renovations, urging patrons to adjust their plans.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (patrons), what (closure), when (tomorrow), and why (renovations).\\n\\nIn summary, extracting the main claim involves identifying key points: what action is taking place, when it occurs, who is affected, and optionally why it\\'s happening. Then, phrasing this information clearly without adding unnecessary details or emotional language.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a good grasp on how to approach this task now.'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim from the given social media post. Let me read through the instructions again to make sure I understand what\\'s needed. The goal is to extract a concise statement that represents the factual assertion of the post without adding any new information or inferring anything beyond what\\'s written.\\n\\nThe post mentions that changes to legislation have been updated on April 27, 2020, and they\\'ve come into force on that day. It also notes that this makes them applicable from now. \\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where (if relevant), why. Here, it\\'s about legislation changes effective from a specific date.\\n\\nI need to remove any personal or subjective language, so phrases like \"just to let you know\" can be omitted for a more neutral tone. Also, I should keep numerical values as they are, like the date.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, the claim is structured clearly without extra details. So, applying that here, I can say that legislation changes came into effect on April 27, 2020, making them applicable from then.\\n\\nI\\'ll make sure to use clear and formal language, avoid acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, which isn\\'t the case here. Also, no need for expansion beyond what\\'s in the post.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the refined claim would state that changes to legislation went into effect on April 27, 2020, making them applicable from that point onwards.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. The user provided some instructions and an example. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the input: there\\'s a post and a claim. The claim is supposed to be a concise statement of the main factual assertion from the post. My task is to take the original claim and refine it according to specific rules.\\n\\nLooking at the example they gave:\\n\\nThe post says that changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\\n\\nThe claim after refinement becomes: \"Changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\"\\n\\nThey also provided some instructions for correct extraction. Let me go through these:\\n\\n1. Use only information from the post; minimal clarification allowed.\\n2. Don\\'t add or infer new facts.\\n3. Maintain intended meaning, even if factually incorrect.\\n4. Keep details regarding Who, What, Where, When, Why if present.\\n5. Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler.\\n6. Preserve named entities exactly as written.\\n7. Use clear, formal, neutral language.\\n8. Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers (like \"my,\" \"beloved\").\\n9. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name.\\n10. Keep numerical values unchanged.\\n11. If multiple facts, select the most important one.\\n12. Keep same language as the post.\\n13. If no changes needed, return original claim.\\n\\nSo, applying this to another example: suppose a post says, \"The new law was passed last week and takes effect on Monday.\" The main fact is about when it took effect. I should extract that without adding anything else. So the claim would be, \"The new law took effect on Monday.\"\\n\\nWait, but in the original example, they kept the same structure. Let me think of another scenario.\\n\\nSuppose a post says, \"My favorite café closed down because of health inspections.\" The main fact here is about the closure cause. So the claim should state that it closed due to health inspections without adding any personal feelings like \"my favorite.\"\\n\\nAnother example: If the post mentions a new feature in a product released on January 15, 2023, the claim would be that the feature was released on that date.\\n\\nI also need to make sure to remove any subjective language. For instance, if someone says, \"This is so exciting!\" I shouldn\\'t include that in the claim; it\\'s neutral and factual.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should keep numerical values as they are, like dates or quantities. Also, named entities should remain unchanged, even if they\\'re part of a phrase that isn\\'t entirely accurate, like \"the first thing that\\'ll strike you.\"\\n\\nI think I have a good grasp on how to approach this now.']",

Let me go through each point one by one.\\n\\n1. Use only information from the post: So no adding any new facts, entities, or context beyond what\\'s in the post itself.\\n2. Do not add or infer new facts: That means I can\\'t assume anything; just take what\\'s written.\\n3.

It affects all cities and towns in our region. Residents should be aware of the changes that take effect tomorrow.\\n\\nWhat would the claim be? \\n\\nI need to extract the main factual assertion.

Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers: Words like \"my,\" \"beloved,\" \"brave,\" etc., shouldn\\'t be there to keep it neutral.\\n9. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name: If the acronym is part of a proper noun, like \"NASA\" instead of \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" then expand it. Otherwise, probably leave as is.\\n10. Keep numerical values unchanged: So any numbers in the post should remain as they are.\\n11. If multiple facts, select the most important one: I need to figure out which fact is most significant to include.\\n12. Keep same language as the post: Maintain the language and tone of the original text.\\n13. If no serious changes needed, return the original claim exactly: So if the claim is already good, just give it back.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided:\\n\\npost:\\nJust to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\\n\\nclaim:\\nThe legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\\n\\nSo, the claim captures the main point: legislative updates became effective on April 27, 2020.\\n\\nNow, if I had to do this for another post, let\\'s say:\\n\\npost: The new law was passed last week. It affects all cities and towns in our region. Residents should be aware of the changes that take effect tomorrow.\\n\\nWhat would the claim be? \\n\\nI need to extract the main factual assertion. Here, it\\'s about a new law taking effect, affecting multiple places, with residents needing awareness. The key point is when it takes effect (tomorrow), who it affects (all cities and towns in our region), and what it entails (a new law passed last week). \\n\\nSo the claim should include when it starts, what it is, where it applies.\\n\\nPossible phrasing: \"The new law took effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nWait, but maybe more precise. The original post says \"changes that take effect tomorrow.\" So perhaps: \"The new law\\'s updates are set to begin tomorrow, affecting all cities and towns in the area.\"\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick the most important fact, it might be when it takes effect.\\n\\nSo the claim could be: \"The new law starts tomorrow, affecting regions across our area.\"\\n\\nBut to include who (residents), what (law), when (tomorrow), where (all cities and towns).\\n\\nHmm, but maybe that\\'s adding more than necessary. The main assertion is about the law taking effect.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick one fact, perhaps the timing: \"The new law begins tomorrow.\"\\n\\nBut including who and where as well might be important. Let me think.\\n\\nIn the original example, they included the date, which was crucial. So in this case, \"tomorrow\" is key.\\n\\nSo, the claim would focus on that: \"The new law takes effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nBut I need to make sure it\\'s'\n '**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\\n\\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\\n   - Extract the main action (event).\\n   - Determine the time frame.\\n   - Identify who is affected.\\n   - Optionally, note the reason or impact.\\n\\n2. **Craft the Claim:**\\n   - Combine the key information into a concise statement.\\n   - Ensure clarity and remove unnecessary details.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nPost: \"The library will be closed tomorrow for renovations.

For instance, \"This is not about a virus, it ends when we say it ends\" can be omitted if it\\'s not crucial to the main claim.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both points but can be made more concise without losing meaning.

Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nThe original claim is: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective, highlighted by the situation where a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\" \\n\\nFirst, I should make sure I\\'m only using information from the post. The user provided two posts. The first one talks about lockdowns in NSW and VIC being unnecessary and ineffective, expressing worry about Queensland\\'s upcoming stricter measures. The second post is about a prisoner requesting to stay in jail because he prefers the confinement over lockdowns.\\n\\nI need to combine these elements into a single claim without adding any new information. The key points are that the lockdowns lack scientific basis and have failed elsewhere, and a prisoner prefers being in prison over the lockdown measures.\\n\\nIn the original claim, it\\'s already included, but I should check if there\\'s a more concise way or if any unnecessary words can be removed. For example, \"highlighted by\" might be too vague, so maybe just state that the prisoner\\'s situation illustrates the point.\\n\\nI also need to maintain a neutral and factual tone, avoiding personal feelings from the original post. So instead of \"I feel for all the people,\" I should stick to facts about the prisoner preferring confinement.\\n\\nSo, refining it: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective. This is evident as a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s clear, concise, and uses only information from the post. It keeps the important details about who (the prisoner), what (prefers confinement), where (jail in Sydney), and why (because of lockdowns).\\n</think>\\n\\nLockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective.

The initial claim was: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective.

The claim should capture both points: lack of scientific basis and ineffectiveness, supported by the prisoner\\'s choice.\\n\\nI also need to keep the same language as the post. For instance, \"This is not about a virus, it ends when we say it ends\" can be omitted if it\\'s not crucial to the main claim.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both points but can be made more concise without losing meaning. Maybe rephrase slightly to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

The author is worried that Queensland might soon face similar strict measures, referring to them as stage 4/5 lockdowns.\\n\\nThen there's a specific part about a prisoner at Sydney's Long Bay correctional center who requested an extension to his sentence to avoid the harsh lockdown.

The original claim includes both EpiPens and insulin as examples of what\\'s not free, and it mentions gift cards as an incentive for flu shots. That seems to align with the post.\\n\\nNext, I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts. The claim correctly uses the terms from the post without adding anything extra. It also maintains a neutral tone by avoiding personal or subjective language.\\n\\nThe original phrasing in the claim is slightly different but retains all necessary details: who (the medical industry), what (EpiPens, insulin, flu shots), where (not specified, but implied as part of their practices), and why (considered unusual). The structure is clear and formal without emotional qualifiers.\\n\\nThere\\'s no need for expanding acronyms since EpiPen is a proper noun. Numerical values aren\\'t involved here. If there were multiple facts, the assistant selected the most important ones, which are the ones about what\\'s free and what\\'s incentivized.\\n\\nThe language matches the post\\'s style, uses formal tone, and avoids subjective terms. So, it looks like the claim meets all the requirements.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe medical industry does not offer EpiPens or insulin for free, while promoting flu shots with incentives such as gift cards.

The instructions specify that I should only use information from the post, not add anything new. Also, I need to maintain the intended meaning even if some facts might be incorrect. That part is important because sometimes users might have typo errors or inaccuracies.\\n\\nNext, I should consider the who, what, where, when, and why of the story in the post. In the given example, the post talks about legislation changes on a specific date. The claim needs to capture this accurately.\\n\\nThe user mentioned keeping the original phrasing as much as possible and removing filler words. Also, preserving named entities exactly as written is crucial. So if there\\'s a name or specific term in the post, I shouldn\\'t change it unless necessary, like expanding an acronym that\\'s part of an official name.\\n\\nMaintaining a neutral and factual tone means avoiding personal feelings or subjective language. Words like \"my\" or \"brave\" should be omitted to keep it formal. Also, acronyms should only be expanded if they\\'re part of an official name; otherwise, leave them as is unless the post expects expansion.\\n\\nNumbers shouldn\\'t be altered because precise values are important. If there are multiple facts, I need to pick the most important one. In this case, the focus is on the legislation update and its effective date.\\n\\nThe example provided by the user refines the claim correctly, keeping it concise and factual without adding any extra information beyond what\\'s in the post. So I should follow that structure.\\n\\nI also notice that sometimes posts might have multiple dates or facts, so choosing the most relevant one is key. In this case, April 27, 2020, is both the update date and when the changes came into force, making it the pivotal fact.\\n\\nAnother point is to ensure clarity while removing any unnecessary words. For instance, \"changes to legislation\" becomes \"legislation changes,\" which is more straightforward.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the claim flows well and accurately represents the original post without adding or subtracting information. The example does this by stating the date when the changes were updated and into force, making it clear and direct.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the refined claim needs to be concise, factually accurate based on the post\\'s info, neutral in tone, and include all necessary details like dates without any extra or filler content.']"

The user provided an example where they took a short text and extracted a concise statement.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The task is to extract the main factual assertion from a given social media post. The instructions are pretty specific: only use information from the post, don\\'t add anything extra, maintain the intended meaning even if it\\'s factually incorrect, and make sure to include details like Who, What, Where, When, Why if present.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they took a post about legislative changes updating on April 27, 2020, and made it a clear statement without personal feelings or extra info. They removed words like \"just to let you know\" and kept the key facts: when the change happened and that it came into effect on that day.\\n\\nSo, applying this to my task, I should look at the post provided and extract the main fact.

I need to make sure not to add anything beyond what\\'s there, keep it neutral, and include all relevant details.\\n\\nI might also need to check for any emotional language or personal pronouns, like \"my\" or \"beloved,\" and remove those to maintain a factual tone. Additionally, ensure that numerical values are kept as they are and avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nIn the example, they removed \"just to let you know\" and rephrased it clearly. I should do similar pruning without losing the essential info. So, from the post, extract when the legislation was updated and that it came into effect on that same day.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. The user provided some instructions, so I need to make sure I understand them before I proceed.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post and a claim. My task is to take the post and extract a concise statement that represents its main factual assertion. But I have to follow certain rules: use only information from the post, don\\'t add anything new, maintain the intended meaning even if it\\'s factually incorrect, keep the who, what, where, when, why details if they\\'re there, remove filler, preserve named entities exactly as written, use clear and formal language, avoid personal or subjective words, expand acronyms unless part of an official name, keep numerical values unchanged, pick the most important facts if there are multiple, and keep the same language as the post.\\n\\nLooking at the example given: the post is about legislation changes on April 27, 2020, becoming effective that day. The claim extracted is \"Changes to legislation were updated on April 27, 2020, and came into effect on that day.\" So it\\'s concise, includes the date, and the key action.\\n\\nNow, let me think through how to approach this step by step. Suppose I get a new post. I need to read it carefully, identify the main facts: who (maybe not relevant here), what (changes to legislation), when (April 27, 2020), where (government website), why (applicable now). The example also mentions that the user is informing others about this change.\\n\\nI should avoid adding any personal feelings or emotional language. For instance, if the post says something like \"This is great news,\" I shouldn\\'t include that in the claim because it\\'s subjective.\\n\\nNext, ensure that all numerical values are kept as they are. So April 27, 2020, remains with the year fully spelled out unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nI also need to be careful with acronyms. If \"legislation\" is expanded properly or if an acronym like \"ACT\" is part of a name, I should leave it as is. But in this case, since it\\'s just \"legislation,\" maybe it\\'s fine without expansion, but the example didn\\'t do that.\\n\\nAnother point is to remove filler words. For example, in the post, phrases like \"just to let you know\" are considered filler and should be omitted in the claim for conciseness.\\n\\nAlso, if there are multiple facts, I have to pick the most important one. In this case, the main fact is the legislative change and its effective date, so that\\'s what\\'s highlighted.\\n\\nI should maintain formal and neutral language throughout. So instead of \"so just a day or so ago\" from the post, it becomes \"and came into effect on that day.\"\\n\\nPutting it all together, I need to extract the key dates and actions without adding any extra information or emotional tone.']"

The post is a short text, probably from a social media platform like Twitter or Instagram. The claim is a concise statement that captures the main factual assertion from the post.\\n\\nThe instructions are quite detailed. I need to make sure I follow them correctly. Let me go through each point one by one.\\n\\n1. Use only information from the post: So no adding any new facts, entities, or context beyond what\\'s in the post itself.\\n2. Do not add or infer new facts: That means I can\\'t assume anything; just take what\\'s written.\\n3. Maintain intended meaning even if factually incorrect: Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, we want factual accuracy, but maybe it\\'s saying to keep the original intent regardless of whether the claim is correct or not.\\n4. Maintain important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, and Why if present in the post: So I need to include specifics like location, dates, etc., if they\\'re mentioned.\\n5. Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler: Keep the wording as close as possible to the post but eliminate unnecessary words.\\n6. Preserve named entities exactly as written: Names or specific terms should stay unchanged.\\n7. Use clear, formal, neutral language: So avoid any personal or emotional language.\\n8. Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers: Words like \"my,\" \"beloved,\" \"brave,\" etc., shouldn\\'t be there to keep it neutral.\\n9. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name: If the acronym is part of a proper noun, like \"NASA\" instead of \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" then expand it. Otherwise, probably leave as is.\\n10. Keep numerical values unchanged: So any numbers in the post should remain as they are.\\n11. If multiple facts, select the most important one: I need to figure out which fact is most significant to include.\\n12. Keep same language as the post: Maintain the language and tone of the original text.\\n13.

So this is applicable from now.\\n\\nclaim:\\nThe legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\\n\\nSo, the claim captures the main point: legislative updates became effective on April 27, 2020.\\n\\nNow, if I had to do this for another post, let\\'s say:\\n\\npost: The new law was passed last week. It affects all cities and towns in our region. Residents should be aware of the changes that take effect tomorrow.\\n\\nWhat would the claim be? \\n\\nI need to extract the main factual assertion. Here, it\\'s about a new law taking effect, affecting multiple places, with residents needing awareness. The key point is when it takes effect (tomorrow), who it affects (all cities and towns in our region), and what it entails (a new law passed last week). \\n\\nSo the claim should include when it starts, what it is, where it applies.\\n\\nPossible phrasing: \"The new law took effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nWait, but maybe more precise. The original post says \"changes that take effect tomorrow.\" So perhaps: \"The new law\\'s updates are set to begin tomorrow, affecting all cities and towns in the area.\"\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick the most important fact, it might be when it takes effect.\\n\\nSo the claim could be: \"The new law starts tomorrow, affecting regions across our area.\"\\n\\nBut to include who (residents), what (law), when (tomorrow), where (all cities and towns).\\n\\nHmm, but maybe that\\'s adding more than necessary. The main assertion is about the law taking effect.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick one fact, perhaps the timing: \"The new law begins tomorrow.\"\\n\\nBut including who and where as well might be important. Let me think.\\n\\nIn the original example, they included the date, which was crucial. So in this case, \"tomorrow\" is key.\\n\\nSo, the claim would focus on that: \"The new law takes effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nBut I need to make sure it\\'s'\n '**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\\n\\n1. **Identify Key Information:**\\n   - Extract the main action (event).\\n   - Determine the time frame.\\n   - Identify who is affected.\\n   - Optionally, note the reason or impact.\\n\\n2. **Craft the Claim:**\\n   - Combine the key information into a concise statement.\\n   - Ensure clarity and remove unnecessary details.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nPost: \"The library will be closed tomorrow for renovations.

The goal is to extract the main factual assertion from the post without adding any new information. Also, I must maintain the original meaning even if there are factual errors. That\\'s important because the user doesn\\'t want me to fact-check or add my own interpretations.\\n\\nLooking at the example given:\\n\\npost: \"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020.

Let\\'s say a post says, \"The park will be closed for maintenance this weekend. The closure starts tomorrow and ends on Monday.\" I need to extract the main claim.\\n\\nFirst, identify who, what, when, where, why if possible. In this case, it\\'s about the park closing, starting tomorrow, ending Monday.\\n\\nSo, the main facts are: The park is closed for maintenance, closure starts tomorrow, ends Monday.\\n\\nPutting that into a concise statement without filler would be \"The park will be closed for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday.\"\\n\\nI should make sure to remove any personal or emotional words.

The user has provided a task where they need to refine a main claim extracted from a social media post. They\\'ve given an example with specific instructions on what to do.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the input carefully. The post is about legislation changes on April 27, 2020, becoming effective that day. The original claim says something about the park closing for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday, which doesn\\'t align with the post\\'s content.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the refined claim only uses information from the post and maintains a neutral tone without adding new facts. I should remove any emotional language or personal pronouns. Also, I should keep the original phrasing as much as possible while being clear and formal.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they took the post\\'s date and legislation update to create a concise claim. So, in this case, since there\\'s no mention of a park closure but rather legislative changes, the correct approach is to focus on that aspect.\\n\\nI should make sure not to infer anything extra. The user wants minimal clarification if possible. So, the refined claim should stick strictly to what\\'s stated without adding any assumptions about why it\\'s important or how it affects users beyond what\\'s mentioned.\\n\\nAlso, I need to keep the language clear and formal, avoiding any subjective terms. For example, instead of saying \"I just wanted to share this update,\" I should state facts directly.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll extract the key dates and focus on the legislation change without adding any extra information or emotional language.'\n None\n 'Alright, let\\'s tackle this step by step. The user has provided a social media post and an example of how the main claim was extracted from it. My task is to follow the instructions and extract the main claim accurately.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the post carefully:\\n\\n\"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nBreaking down the post:\\n\\n- The user is informing others about a legislative update.\\n- The act was updated on April 27, 2020.\\n- It came into effect on that same day.\\n- It\\'s applicable starting from that day.\\n\\nNow, I need to extract the main claim. The key facts here are the date of the update and when it became effective. The post mentions both, but perhaps the more important point is when it came into force because that indicates its current applicability.\\n\\nIn the example provided, the claim was: \"The legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\"\\n\\nThis captures the main point succinctly.\\n\\nSo applying similar logic to another hypothetical post:\\n\\n\" Residents are reminded that the local ordinance regarding trash collection now requires all households to separate recyclables and compostables by Friday. The new rule takes effect this week.\"\\n\\nMain facts: \\n- New local ordinance about trash collection.\\n- Requirement for separating materials by a specific date (Friday).\\n- Effective this week.\\n\\nThe main claim would highlight when it starts (this week) and the requirement (separating recyclables and compostables). So, \"A new trash separation requirement is effective this week.\"\\n\\nThis keeps it clear and captures both who (residents), what (new rule), and when (this week).\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"A major highway closure is set to begin next Monday due to construction. Drivers are advised to plan alternative routes.\\n\\nMain facts:\\n- Highway closure starting next Monday.\\n- Reason: Construction.\\n- Impact: Drivers should take alternate routes.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A significant highway closure begins on Monday for construction, urging drivers to use alternative routes.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (drivers), what (closure), when (Monday), and why (construction).\\n\\nIn cases where there are multiple facts but one is more prominent, focus on the key action or event. For instance, in a post about both a new law and its effective date, the main claim would likely be about the law taking effect.\\n\\nSo if the post says: \"A new environmental regulation was enacted this month, mandating reduced emissions by large factories starting next year.\"\\n\\nThe main facts are:\\n- New regulation.\\n- Enacted this month.\\n- Mandates reduced emissions.\\n- Effective next year.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A new environmental regulation requiring reduced emissions from large factories begins next year.\"\\n\\nThis includes the new regulation, its enactment date, and its target.\\n\\nAnother aspect is to avoid adding any personal or emotional language. For example, instead of saying \"This is a big change,\" it\\'s better to state facts without judgment.\\n\\nNow, considering all this, if I have a post that says: \"The library will be closed tomorrow for renovations. Patrons are advised to plan accordingly.\"\\n\\nThe main claim would focus on the closure and its reason. So, \"The library is closed tomorrow for renovations, urging patrons to adjust their plans.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (patrons), what (closure), when (tomorrow), and why (renovations).\\n\\nIn summary, extracting the main claim involves identifying key points: what action is taking place, when it occurs, who is affected, and optionally why it\\'s happening. Then, phrasing this information clearly without adding unnecessary details or emotional language.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a good grasp on how to approach this task now.'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim from the given social media post. Let me read through the instructions again to make sure I understand what\\'s needed. The goal is to extract a concise statement that represents the factual assertion of the post without adding any new information or inferring anything beyond what\\'s written.\\n\\nThe post mentions that changes to legislation have been updated on April 27, 2020, and they\\'ve come into force on that day. It also notes that this makes them applicable from now. \\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where (if relevant), why. Here, it\\'s about legislation changes effective from a specific date.\\n\\nI need to remove any personal or subjective language, so phrases like \"just to let you know\" can be omitted for a more neutral tone. Also, I should keep numerical values as they are, like the date.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, the claim is structured clearly without extra details. So, applying that here, I can say that legislation changes came into effect on April 27, 2020, making them applicable from then.\\n\\nI\\'ll make sure to use clear and formal language, avoid acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, which isn\\'t the case here. Also, no need for expansion beyond what\\'s in the post.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the refined claim would state that changes to legislation went into effect on April 27, 2020, making them applicable from that point onwards.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. The user provided some instructions and an example. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the input: there\\'s a post and a claim. The claim is supposed to be a concise statement of the main factual assertion from the post. My task is to take the original claim and refine it according to specific rules.\\n\\nLooking at the example they gave:\\n\\nThe post says that changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\\n\\nThe claim after refinement becomes: \"Changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\"\\n\\nThey also provided some instructions for correct extraction. Let me go through these:\\n\\n1. Use only information from the post; minimal clarification allowed.\\n2. Don\\'t add or infer new facts.\\n3. Maintain intended meaning, even if factually incorrect.\\n4. Keep details regarding Who, What, Where, When, Why if present.\\n5. Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler.\\n6. Preserve named entities exactly as written.\\n7. Use clear, formal, neutral language.\\n8. Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers (like \"my,\" \"beloved\").\\n9. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name.\\n10. Keep numerical values unchanged.\\n11. If multiple facts, select the most important one.\\n12. Keep same language as the post.\\n13. If no changes needed, return original claim.\\n\\nSo, applying this to another example: suppose a post says, \"The new law was passed last week and takes effect on Monday.\" The main fact is about when it took effect. I should extract that without adding anything else. So the claim would be, \"The new law took effect on Monday.\"\\n\\nWait, but in the original example, they kept the same structure. Let me think of another scenario.\\n\\nSuppose a post says, \"My favorite café closed down because of health inspections.\" The main fact here is about the closure cause. So the claim should state that it closed due to health inspections without adding any personal feelings like \"my favorite.\"\\n\\nAnother example: If the post mentions a new feature in a product released on January 15, 2023, the claim would be that the feature was released on that date.\\n\\nI also need to make sure to remove any subjective language. For instance, if someone says, \"This is so exciting!\" I shouldn\\'t include that in the claim; it\\'s neutral and factual.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should keep numerical values as they are, like dates or quantities. Also, named entities should remain unchanged, even if they\\'re part of a phrase that isn\\'t entirely accurate, like \"the first thing that\\'ll strike you.\"\\n\\nI think I have a good grasp on how to approach this now.']"

         "['Okay, I\\'m looking at this task where I need to refine a main claim extracted from a social media post. The user has provided some instructions and an example, so I should make sure to follow those closely.\\n\\nFirst, the input includes a \"post\" which is a short text on social media, and a \"claim\" that\\'s a concise statement of the main factual assertion. My job is to take the post and extract the claim in a refined way, following specific guidelines.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, it seems like they took the original claim and rephrased it to be more formal and neutral, removing any personal or emotional language. For instance, changing \"my\" to \"their\" or other similar adjustments. They also made sure to keep the key facts: who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket), how much ($17 billion), the technology used (monitoring via phones), the duration (10 years preservation), and the source (London casket makers).\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new information. So if the post mentions something like \"MUGABE\\'S CASEKET\" repeatedly, I should use that as is, but perhaps make it more concise. Also, acronyms or specific names should be kept exactly as written unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nIn the example, they expanded \"None\" at the end to a full sentence. Wait, no, looking back, in the post, there\\'s a line that says \"The white is still at the top using our brains None.\" Hmm, maybe that was just part of the original text and doesn\\'t contribute to the main claim, so it was excluded.\\n\\nNow, for the given task, I need to apply similar steps. Let me break down each step as per instructions:\\n\\n1. **Use only information from the post**: So I can\\'t make up anything or infer new facts. Just take what\\'s there.\\n2. **Don\\'t add or infer new facts**: Same as above, stick strictly to what\\'s in the post.\\n3. **Maintain intended meaning even if factually incorrect**: This is tricky because sometimes posts might have errors, but I shouldn\\'t correct them; just represent the claim as per the user\\'s instructions.\\n4. **Include Who, What, Where, When, Why details if present**: So if the post provides context about why this technology was used, include that in the refined claim. But in the example given, it seems like only the facts are included without extra context.\\n5. **Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler**: I can use phrases from the post as they are, but eliminate unnecessary words or redundant information.\\n6. **Use clear, formal, neutral language**: So avoid any subjective terms, keep it factual.\\n7. **Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers**: Terms like \"my\" or \"brave\" should be omitted to keep it neutral.\\n8. **Expand acronyms unless part of an official name**: For example, if \"Casket\" is part of a proper noun, I can leave it as is. If it\\'s an acronym that stands for something else, maybe expand it, but only if necessary and without adding new info.\\n9. **Keep numerical values unchanged**: So $17 billion stays as is.\\n10. **If multiple facts, select the most important one**: The example seems to include several facts: the casket\\'s value, the technology, preservation time, and the source. But it condenses them into a single claim that covers all these points concisely.\\n11. **Keep same language as the post**: So if the original uses a specific phrase like \"CASEKET\" or \"casket,\" use that exact term unless instructed otherwise.\\n12. **If no serious changes needed, return the original claim exactly**: So if the original is already good, just return it.\\n\\nLooking at the example output, they took the main points: who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket), value ($17 billion), technology (monitoring via phones), duration (10 years), and source (London casket makers). Then they rephrased it in a formal way without personal terms. They also made sure to include the preservation aspect as an implication from the London Casket makers.\\n\\nSo for the given post, I need to extract these elements:\\n\\n- Robert Mugabe\\'s casket\\n- Valued at 17 billion\\n- Incorporates technology allowing family monitoring via phones post-interment\\n- System preserves remains for up to ten years\\n- Supplied by London Casket makers\\n\\nNow, putting that together in a formal, neutral tone. Also, looking at the example, they started with \"Robert Mugabe\\'s casket...\" which is clear and factual.\\n\\nI should also check if there are any terms I need to expand or keep as acronyms. In the post, it says \"'\n \"Robert Mugabe's casket, valued at $17 billion, has been equipped with technology that allows family monitoring via phone devices following interment. Supplied by London Casket makers, this system ensures preservation for up to ten years.\"\n \"Robert Mugabe's casket, valued at $17 billion and equipped with technology, allows family monitoring via phone devices after interment.

So I\\'ll rephrase each point without adding any extra information or correcting facts based on the user\\'s instruction not to infer new things.\\n\\nI should avoid personal qualifiers like \"my\" or \"their\" unless necessary for clarity. Also, check if any acronyms need expansion. In this case, it doesn\\'t seem necessary as they are part of proper nouns.\\n\\nFinally, structure the claim to include all these points clearly and succinctly.'\n 'Okay, I\\'m looking at this social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket. The main point here is the use of technology in his casket. So, first, I need to extract the main claim from the post.\\n\\nThe post mentions that the casket is worth $17 billion and has been computerized. This allows family members to watch his remains through their phones after he\\'s buried. It also talks about how the technology will keep his remains preserved for ten years, supplied by London Casket makers. \\n\\nI need to make sure I only use information from the post without adding anything extra. The claim should be concise and stick to the facts given. So, starting with the casket\\'s value and the fact that it has monitoring technology.\\n\\nI should avoid any personal or emotional language. Words like \"family can watch his remains\" need to stay as they are but make sure the sentence is clear and formal. Also, I shouldn\\'t include extra details about how the system works unless it\\'s crucial for the main point.\\n\\nThe post repeats some information, so I can consolidate that into a single statement without losing the essential facts. The key elements are who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket with technology), where (supplied by London casket makers), when (after interment) and why (preservation).\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim doesn\\'t have any filler words or emotional qualifiers. For example, \"family can watch his remains through their phone devices\" is clear and factual.\\n\\nExpanding acronyms isn\\'t necessary here unless it\\'s part of an official name, which it\\'s not in this case. The value is specified as $17 billion, so I should keep that exact number.\\n\\nIf there were multiple facts, like the technology and the preservation, I need to select the most important one. In this case, both are crucial, but combining them into a single sentence about the casket being equipped with tech for monitoring and preservation covers both points succinctly.\\n\\nThe language of the claim should mirror the post\\'s original phrasing as much as possible while maintaining a neutral tone. So, \"has been computerized\" is better than more technical terms to keep it clear.\\n\\nI also need to check that all named entities are preserved exactly as written, like Robert Mugabe and London Casket makers.\\n\\nNo personal qualifiers here since the post is already in a neutral tone, so I don\\'t have to worry about words like \"beloved\" or \"brave.\"\\n\\nFinally, the claim should be clear and factual without any subjective language. So, putting it all together: Robert Mugabe\\'s casket costing $17 billion has technology allowing family monitoring via phones post-interment, preserving remains for ten years as supplied by London Casket makers.'\n 'Okay, I\\'m looking at this social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket. The main point seems to be that the casket is very expensive, $17 billion, and has some advanced technology in it. It can monitor his remains using phone devices after he\\'s buried. So, the key facts here are who (Mugabe), what (casket with tech), where (presumably Zimbabwe since he\\'s a public figure there), when (after interment), and why (to allow family monitoring).\\n\\nThe user provided some instructions on how to refine this claim. I need to make sure not to add any new facts, just extract the main assertion. So, I should avoid adding emotional words like \"brave\" or \"evil.\" Also, I have to maintain the original phrasing as much as possible and remove filler words.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it mentions that the casket was made by London Casket makers. That\\'s an important detail, so I should include it. It also talks about the technology protecting the remains for up to ten years. So, the main claim should include the cost, the tech feature, and who supplied the casket.\\n\\nI need to ensure clarity and formality without adding any personal or subjective language. Also, numerical values like $17 billion should remain unchanged. Since there are multiple facts in the post, I have to pick the most important one. The primary focus seems to be on the casket\\'s features and cost rather than the makers\\' statement.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the refined claim would state that Mugabe\\'s casket is worth $17 billion, equipped with technology allowing family monitoring via phones after burial, and made by London Casket makers. It should also mention the ten-year preservation aspect without adding any extra information.\\n\\nSo, the final claim should be concise, include all necessary details without being wordy, and stick to the facts provided in the post.'\n 'Okay, I\\'m looking at this social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket.

The output should only be the final claim text without any additional info or explanations.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, the user took a lengthy social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket and extracted the main claim: \"Robert Mugabe\\'s family can watch his remains via phone devices after his interment.\" That seems straightforward.\\n\\nNow, considering the instructions:\\n\\n- Use only info from the post.\\n- Don\\'t add new facts or infer anything beyond what\\'s there.\\n- Maintain intended meaning even if factually incorrect.\\n- Include details about Who, What, Where, When, Why if present.\\n- Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler.\\n- Preserve named entities exactly as written.\\n- Use clear, formal, neutral language.\\n- Remove personal or subjective qualifiers.\\n- Expand acronyms unless part of an official name.\\n- Keep numerical values unchanged.\\n- Select the most important fact if multiple are present.\\n- Keep the same language as the post.\\n- If no changes needed, return the original.\\n\\nIn this case, the claim is already concise and uses the exact wording from the post. It includes who (Robert Mugabe\\'s family), what (watch his remains via phone devices), when (after interment). It doesn\\'t add any extra information or change the phrasing. The language is neutral and factual without any emotional terms.\\n\\nI should check if there are any changes needed. Let me read through the post again to ensure I\\'m not missing anything crucial. The post mentions that the casket was made by London Casket makers, costing 17 billion, and has a feature to protect the remains for ten years. However, the main assertion is about family access via phones.\\n\\nThe claim correctly captures the primary factual point without extra details or incorrect inclusions. It\\'s concise and adheres to the guidelines provided. So, no changes are needed beyond what\\'s already done.']"

It\\'s neutral, factual, and sticks to the information given without adding anything extra.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t see any changes needed beyond that. The final claim should be as is.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim from this social media post. The original post says: \"Sikh with no mustache in Delhi farmers protest. According to astronomy such an event happens once in a century.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to extract the main factual assertion. It seems like there are two main points here: one about the Sikh participant and another about the astronomical alignment.\\n\\nThe user provided instructions on how to do this correctly. They mentioned using only information from the post without adding new facts. So I should avoid inferring anything beyond what\\'s written.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim, it starts with \"A Sikh participant...\". The post doesn\\'t specify that there are multiple participants or if this is a general observation, so maybe starting with \"A\" is fine as it\\'s the only information given.\\n\\nThe second part says the event happens once in a century. I think \"once-in-a-century\" is an astronomical alignment, so that should be included to show the cause or context.\\n\\nI also need to ensure clarity and formality while removing any filler or subjective language. The original claim uses commas which might make it a bit choppy, but keeping it concise is important.\\n\\nLet me check if I\\'m maintaining all the required elements: who (Sikh participant), what (no mustache), where (Delhi farmers protest), when (once in a century alignment). That seems covered.\\n\\nI should also make sure not to add any personal or emotional language. The original post didn\\'t use any, so that\\'s good.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together: \"A Sikh participant in the Delhi farmers\\' protest has been observed without a mustache, coinciding with once-in-a-century astronomical alignments.\" \\n\\nI think this captures both points accurately and stays neutral. It also uses the same language as the post, just making it slightly smoother.']"

         "['Okay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nThe post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the executive director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The key points he made are that vaccines kill more people than they save and that early treatments like Ivermectin are more successful, especially with low case numbers in Uttar Pradesh, India.\\n\\nI need to extract a concise statement without adding any new information. I have to keep the original phrasing as much as possible, remove filler, maintain neutrality, and include the important details about who, what, where, when, and why.\\n\\nThe initial claim is already pretty good: it mentions Steve Kirsch\\'s position, his testimony before the FDA, his argument against vaccines, and his points about Ivermectin in India. However, I should make sure to remove any unnecessary words or emotional language without changing the facts.\\n\\nLooking at the post again, there are some repetitive phrases and possibly redundant information. For instance, \"Steve Kirsch also pointed out that early treatments...\" repeats similar ideas. I might need to streamline this to avoid redundancy while keeping all essential points.\\n\\nI should ensure that numerical values are kept as is, but here it\\'s about case numbers, so no specific figures are needed unless they were mentioned. The post doesn\\'t specify exact numbers except for Uttar Pradesh cases being nearly non-existent.\\n\\nAlso, the language should be clear and formal, avoiding personal or subjective terms. Words like \"argued\" might be fine, but I need to maintain a factual tone.\\n\\nAnother thing is acronyms. If any are present, I should expand them unless they\\'re part of an official name. Here, \"FDA\" and \"Ivermectin\" are probably fine as they are.\\n\\nNow, looking at the claim provided by the user: It includes all the main points without adding anything new. However, it might be a bit long. Perhaps I can make it more concise while retaining all necessary information.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s claim is actually quite well-structured. It starts with Steve Kirsch\\'s role, testifies before FDA, argues vaccines kill more than they save, and mentions early treatments being successful due to low cases in Uttar Pradesh. It also notes the Ivermectin story was reported on Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nBut the user might want it even shorter, removing some repeating information or perhaps trimming down the description of his points for brevity without losing essential details.\\n\\nI think the initial claim is solid. It captures both arguments: vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial and early treatments like Ivermectin being effective. It also includes the location (Uttar Pradesh) and references the source (Gateway Pundit). \\n\\nIs there anything else? The post mentions that this was part of a hearing, specifically the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s open session. Maybe including that could add more context, but it might make the claim longer.\\n\\nI should stick to the facts presented without adding any inferences. So, the main points are Steve Kirsch, his position, testifying before FDA, arguing vaccines are more dangerous, mentioning Ivermectin and its effectiveness in India.\\n\\nTherefore, the refined claim should succinctly capture these elements without unnecessary words or emotional language.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post.

He also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing out Israel and Uttar Pradesh as examples. There\\'s a lot of repetition in the post, so I need to extract the key points without adding any new info.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify who Steve Kirsch is—he\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The main event is his testimony before the FDA. Now, the claim needs to capture his argument and the supporting data he used.\\n\\nHe argued that vaccines are more dangerous than beneficial, which is a strong statement. Also, he highlighted early treatments like Ivermectin being effective. In India\\'s Uttar Pradesh, case numbers dropped significantly after using Ivermectin, which was previously reported on Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim is concise and sticks to the facts from the post without adding anything extra. The original claim was pretty good but had some minor issues like \"kill more people than they save\" versus \"more dangerous.\" Also, it mentioned Israel but didn\\'t elaborate, so maybe focusing on Uttar Pradesh would be better for brevity.\\n\\nI should also remove any links or references to Gateway Pundit since the claim shouldn\\'t include those unless necessary. The language needs to stay formal and neutral without any emotional qualifiers.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the main points are Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA about vaccines being more harmful than helpful and effectively reducing cases with Ivermectin in India.'\n 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. From what I gather, he\\'s arguing against vaccines, saying they might kill more people than they save. That seems like a strong statement, so that should be the main point.\\n\\nHe also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing to Israel and Uttar Pradesh in India where Ivermectin is used. Cases there are nearly non-existent now, which supports his claim about early treatments working better than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also talks about this hearing being part of a larger meeting by the FDA, specifically mentioning the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s Open Public Hearing Session. There are some official terms like CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) which might add context, but I think they can be omitted since the main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new facts or entities beyond what\\'s in the post. So no introducing data or figures not already mentioned. Also, I have to maintain a neutral tone without adding personal or emotional language. Words like \"my\" or \"beloved\" shouldn\\'t be there.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim: it mentions Steve Kirsch testifying, arguing vaccines kill more than they save, and highlighting early treatments with Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh. The refined version should keep all that but make it concise. Maybe remove some redundant phrases like \"was up next to testify\" as it\\'s already covered.\\n\\nI also notice there\\'s a lot of repetition in the post about following on bio links and mentions of Jim Hoft. Those can be trimmed to keep the main claim clean. The structure needs to flow logically: who, what, where, when, why. So starting with Steve Kirsch, his role, testifying before FDA, his argument against vaccines, supporting it with examples from Israel and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nI should avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since \"FDA\" is already clear, maybe just keep it as is without expansion. Also, numerical values aren\\'t mentioned here, so no changes needed there.\\n\\nIf multiple facts are present, I need to pick the most important one. The main point seems to be Kirsch\\'s argument about vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial, supported by treatment success stories.\\n\\nThe language should stay formal and clear, matching the social media post\\'s tone but without any filler words. Remove any emotional terms like \"brave\" or \"evil,\" which aren\\'t present here, so that shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the refined claim captures Steve Kirsch\\'s testimony, his stance on vaccines, and the evidence he uses about early treatments. It stays factual without adding anything extra.']"

The government is advising against challenging people to wear face coverings because it can lead to personal liability under specific sections of the Equality Act 2010.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key elements: who (government advice), what (not to challenge people to wear face coverings), why (liability). Also, there are penalties mentioned, like fines up to £5,000 and compensation payments. These details are important.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new information or infer anything beyond what\\'s stated. The original claim seems pretty concise already. However, it might be a bit lengthy for a main claim, so maybe I can condense it without losing essential info.\\n\\nLooking at the instruction to use formal and neutral language, I should remove any emotional words like \"good reason\" or \"my.\" Also, avoid expanding acronyms unless necessary; here, Equality Act 2010 is clear enough. The numerical values should stay as they are.\\n\\nThe original claim includes two sections of the act: 112 and 119. I think including both gives a complete picture, so that part stays. I\\'ll make sure to list them correctly without adding any extra explanations about what each section entails.\\n\\nI should also ensure clarity on who is liable—both individuals and employees are mentioned, so that detail is important to include.\\n\\nAfter reviewing, the refined claim seems accurate.

Additionally, it mentions compensation between £900 and £9,000 for disability discrimination under section 119.\\n\\nIn the initial claim, they included both sections, but I need to refine this. The user\\'s instructions say to extract only the main factual assertion without adding or inferring new facts. So maybe including all sections is too much.\\n\\nThe main point seems to be that not wearing a face covering can lead to legal consequences. Focusing on section 112 and the fine is probably sufficient. Including the compensation part might be an additional fact but isn\\'t the main claim.\\n\\nI should remove redundant information like \"for GOOD REASON\" as it\\'s not factual. Also, avoid personalizing terms like \"my\" or \"beloved.\" The language should be clear and formal.\\n\\nSo, refining it to mention the legal section and the potential fine without adding extra details about compensation.

The second part about compensation is an additional fact but maybe less central to the main claim.\\n\\nSo, the refined claim should focus on the legal consequences under section 112, without including unnecessary details like the compensation part unless it\\'s integral to the main assertion.\\n\\nI\\'ll structure it as a concise statement that captures the who, what, why, and the consequences.

It mentions that not following this advice can lead to personal liability and fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010. Additionally, aiding contraventions can result in compensation orders under section 119 of the same act.\\n\\nThe sample claim accurately reflects these points but is a bit more concise.

I must maintain the intended meaning, even if some details might be incorrect. Also, important details like who (individuals), what (face coverings advice), where (implicitly stated), when (current advice), why (to avoid liability) need to be preserved.\\n\\nThe original phrasing should be retained as much as possible. The post uses \"may be personally liable\" and mentions the fine amount and sections, so these details are crucial. I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts; for example, not making assumptions about who the compensation is directed towards beyond what\\'s stated.\\n\\nI also need to avoid emotional language, keep numerical values unchanged, expand acronyms if necessary, but in this case, they\\'re already spelled out. If multiple facts exist, select the most important one, which seems to be the liability and fines part as it directly addresses the main consequence of not following advice.\\n\\nThe post\\'s language is clear, so maintaining that tone is important. No personal qualifiers like \"my\" or \"beloved\" are present here, so that aspect is already handled.\\n\\nIn summary, the extracted claim should clearly state the potential liability and the specific legal sections without adding any extra information or altering the original phrasing beyond what\\'s necessary for clarity.'\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. The user provided an example where they took a long post about legal repercussions and condensed it into a concise statement. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read through the post carefully. It mentions that not following government advice on wearing face coverings could lead to personal liability and fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010. There\\'s also mention of potential discrimination claims leading to compensation payments, but the main threat seems to be about individual liability.\\n\\nI should focus only on information from the post without adding anything extra. I\\'ll remove any emotional language like \"good reason\" and stick to facts. The key elements are who might be liable (individuals), what happens (fines up to £5k), why (under section 112 of Equality Act 2010).\\n\\nI need to keep the original phrasing as much as possible but make it concise. So, instead of \"my\" or other personal pronouns, I\\'ll use formal language. Also, make sure not to include any filler words.\\n\\nThe example given by the user is clear and formal. It includes who (individuals), what (fines), where (Equality Act 2010), and why (defying advice). So, I should follow a similar structure but ensure it\\'s in one concise sentence without unnecessary details about compensation since that wasn\\'t the primary threat mentioned.\\n\\nWait, in the original post, there are two parts: liability for offences under section 112 leading to fines and potential discrimination claims under section 119. But since the main advice is about not challenging the face covering rule, the primary issue is the first part about personal liability and fines.\\n\\nI should make sure not to include the second part unless it\\'s crucial. The example focused only on the fine part. So, I\\'ll structure the claim around that without mentioning the compensation.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the claim should clearly state that individuals may be liable for fines up to £5k under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010 for defying government advice on face coverings.']"

         "['Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. The user provided a sample where they took the original claim and refined it according to specific instructions. Let me break down what needs to be done.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post and a claim. My task is to refine the claim based on the given rules. I should start by reading both carefully.\\n\\nThe post says that challenging people to wear face coverings isn\\'t advisable because of legal consequences. It mentions two sections of the Equality Act 2010: section 112 for personal liability up to £5,000 and section 119 for compensation if there\\'s disability discrimination.\\n\\nThe original claim is more detailed, listing both sections and their outcomes. The refined claim should maintain the key facts without adding any extra information or inferring new data.\\n\\nI need to ensure that I only use info from the post. No adding facts, so I shouldn\\'t include explanations or context. Maintain the intended meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect elsewhere, but since this is a factual assertion, accuracy is important.\\n\\nThe user wants clear, formal, neutral language. So, I should avoid emotional words like \"my\" or \"brave.\" Also, expand acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, but in this case, it\\'s just referring to the act by its number and name.\\n\\nI should keep numerical values unchanged and preserve named entities exactly as written. If there are multiple facts, I need to select the most important one, which seems to be both sections mentioned because they each contribute to different penalties.\\n\\nThe language should stay the same as the post, so avoid any changes in tone unless necessary for clarity. Also, no personal qualifiers—so remove words like \"my\" or \"beloved.\"\\n\\nLooking at the sample refinement provided by the user, they simplified it by stating that not wearing face coverings can lead to legal consequences under two specific sections of the act, including potential fines and compensation.\\n\\nI should follow this approach: mention the main action (not wearing face coverings), state the consequence, include both relevant sections without explaining them further, and keep the language clear and neutral.'\n \"Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. The user provided both the original post and an example claim, so I should use that as a guide.\\n\\nFirst, the post talks about government advice against challenging people to wear face coverings. It mentions legal consequences under specific sections of the Equality Act 2010. There are two main points here: personal liability for employees and potential fines up to £5,000, as well as possible compensation for disability discrimination cases.\\n\\nIn the example claim, they combined these two facts into one concise statement. They used formal language, kept all the important details like who (government advice), what (not challenging people to wear face coverings), why (legal reasons under section 112 of Equality Act 2010 leading to liability and fines), and also included the second part about compensation from section 119.\\n\\nI should ensure that I don't add any new information or infer anything beyond what's in the post. The claim needs to be clear, formal, and neutral without personal qualifiers. I'll use the same language as the post but avoid any filler words. Also, I need to make sure all named entities are preserved exactly.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they included both sections of the Equality Act 2010, so that's important to keep. The claim also states the consequences clearly without emotional language. \\n\\nI should make sure not to miss any key details like the maximum fine amount or the compensation range. Also, the structure should be logical, starting with the government advice and then moving on to the legal implications.\\n\\nLet me piece this together: start by stating the government's advice, mention that it's against challenging face coverings due to legal reasons under section 112, which can lead to personal liability and fines up to £5,000. Then, include that there's another aspect under section 119 regarding compensation for disability discrimination.\\n\\nI think that covers both main points without adding anything extra. The claim should flow smoothly while being factual and concise.\"]"

They mention that these lockdowns have no basis in science and have failed in other countries too. They also express worry about Queensland being next, with groundwork laid for stricter lockdowns there. The user then contrasts this with a prisoner's statement preferring jail over lockdowns because he can live more freely inside, including socializing in groups.\\n\\nSo the main points are: lockdowns lack scientific basis and have failed; they're harsher than necessary; there's a prisoner example illustrating the preference for confinement over lockdowns.\\n\\nThe claim should include who (Australia), what (lockdown measures), where (specific regions like NSW/VIC/Queensland), when (current state), why (lack of science basis). It needs to be neutral, formal, clear.\\n\\nPutting it together: Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective, as evidenced by the situation where a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\"\n 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nThe post starts talking about the sad state of Australia due to COVID lockdowns in NSW and VIC. It mentions that these lockdowns have no scientific basis and have failed elsewhere too. Then it shifts to talking about a prisoner, Mick Danks, who prefers staying in jail because he can avoid the lockdown measures. He\\'s served most of his sentence but wants an extension so he doesn\\'t have to deal with the outside lockdown.\\n\\nSo the main points are that the lockdowns lack scientific support and are ineffective. The example given is the prisoner preferring confinement over the restrictions.\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim is concise, only using info from the post, without adding anything extra. I should avoid filler words like \"very sad\" or emotional phrases. Also, maintain the original language but remove any personal or subjective terms.\\n\\nThe key facts are that lockdowns have no basis in science and have failed, as shown by someone choosing confinement over restrictions. That\\'s the main assertion here.'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through it carefully.\\n\\nThe original claim is: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective, highlighted by the situation where a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\" \\n\\nFirst, I should make sure I\\'m only using information from the post. The user provided two posts. The first one talks about lockdowns in NSW and VIC being unnecessary and ineffective, expressing worry about Queensland\\'s upcoming stricter measures. The second post is about a prisoner requesting to stay in jail because he prefers the confinement over lockdowns.\\n\\nI need to combine these elements into a single claim without adding any new information. The key points are that the lockdowns lack scientific basis and have failed elsewhere, and a prisoner prefers being in prison over the lockdown measures.\\n\\nIn the original claim, it\\'s already included, but I should check if there\\'s a more concise way or if any unnecessary words can be removed. For example, \"highlighted by\" might be too vague, so maybe just state that the prisoner\\'s situation illustrates the point.\\n\\nI also need to maintain a neutral and factual tone, avoiding personal feelings from the original post. So instead of \"I feel for all the people,\" I should stick to facts about the prisoner preferring confinement.\\n\\nSo, refining it: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective. This is evident as a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s clear, concise, and uses only information from the post. It keeps the important details about who (the prisoner), what (prefers confinement), where (jail in Sydney), and why (because of lockdowns).'\n 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim from the given social media post.

The claim should capture both points: lack of scientific basis and ineffectiveness, supported by the prisoner\\'s choice.\\n\\nI also need to keep the same language as the post. For instance, \"This is not about a virus, it ends when we say it ends\" can be omitted if it\\'s not crucial to the main claim.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both points but can be made more concise without losing meaning.

         "['Okay, I need to refine the main claim extracted from this social media post. Let me read through the instructions again to make sure I understand what\\'s needed.\\n\\nThe goal is to extract a concise statement that represents the post’s main factual assertion using only information from the post. I shouldn\\'t add any new facts or context. I have to maintain the intended meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect, and keep the original phrasing as much as possible.\\n\\nLooking at the post, there are two main sections. The first part talks about lockdowns in NSW and VIC being ineffective and causing suffering. It mentions that the user is worried about Queensland\\'s upcoming restrictions. The second part discusses a prisoner, Mick Danks, who prefers jail because he can avoid lockdown measures, having more freedom and stability there.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both parts: the failure of lockdowns and the situation in Queensland, as well as Mick Danks\\' experience. However, the instructions say to select the most important fact if there are multiple facts. So I need to decide which is more central.\\n\\nThe main assertion seems to be about the lockdown measures lacking a scientific basis and being ineffective. The part about Queensland is a prediction based on groundwork laid, so it\\'s related but perhaps not as immediate. Mick Danks\\' situation adds another layer but might be an example rather than the main point.\\n\\nI should focus on the main assertion: that the lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack scientific basis and have proven ineffective, leading to suffering. Also, there\\'s a concern about Queensland possibly implementing stricter measures.\\n\\nWait, the original claim also mentioned prisoners having more freedom. Should I include that? It adds an important detail about how lockdowns affect differently based on settings. However, if I\\'m selecting the most important fact, maybe the main point is the effectiveness of the lockdowns.\\n\\nSo, to refine it, I can start by stating that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a basis in science and are ineffective. Then mention the suffering involved and the concern about Queensland\\'s upcoming measures. I should remove any emotional language like \"stark\" or \"sad,\" and keep the phrasing formal and neutral.\\n\\nAlso, make sure to include the entities properly: New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC). Maybe rephrase to avoid repetition and ensure clarity.\\n\\nPutting it together: The main factual assertion is that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a scientific basis and are ineffective, leading to significant suffering. Additionally, there\\'s concern about similar measures being prepared for Queensland, possibly escalating restrictions further. It\\'s important to mention Mick Danks\\' situation as an example of how the lockdown affects prisoners differently.\\n\\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should select only the most important fact if multiple facts are present. So perhaps I need to prioritize: the main claim is about the effectiveness and basis of the lockdowns in NSW and VIC, leading to suffering. The part about Queensland comes next as a prediction. Mick Danks\\' experience is an example but might be considered additional information rather than the main assertion.\\n\\nTherefore, the refined claim should focus on the lack of scientific basis, ineffectiveness, suffering, and the concern for Queensland without adding too much detail from the example.\\n\\nSo, finalizing: Lockdowns in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) lack a basis in science and have proven ineffective, leading to significant suffering for residents. Additionally, there are concerns that similar measures could be implemented in Queensland. This situation highlights the broader issues with current COVID-19 strategies.\\n\\nWait, but the original post had Mick Danks\\' quote about preferring jail because of lockdowns. That\\'s a specific example that adds context about how restrictions affect different groups. Should I include that?\\n\\nThe instructions say to retain important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, and Why if present. Mick Danks is a prisoner in Sydney, so adding his perspective could provide a \\'Why\\' aspect—how lockdowns are affecting people\\'s lives and choices.\\n\\nSo perhaps the claim should mention his situation as an example of how lockdown measures impact certain groups differently. Therefore, including it would add context without inferring new facts.\\n\\nThus, combining both points: the main assertion is about the effectiveness of lockdowns leading to suffering, along with the example of Mick Danks illustrating the differential impact.\\n\\nSo refining again: The main factual assertion is that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a scientific basis and are ineffective, causing significant suffering among residents. There\\'s concern for Queensland as stricter measures may be implemented soon. Additionally, prisoners like Mick Danks experience more freedom within correctional facilities than under strict lockdowns outside, highlighting the varied impacts of these measures.\\n\\nBut perhaps that\\'s too detailed. The instructions say to maintain clear, formal, and neutral language without adding or inferring new facts. So maybe just include the main points about the effectiveness and the concern for Queensland, along with the example of Mick Danks as'\n 'The main factual assertion is that the lockdowns implemented in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) lack a scientific basis, are ineffective, and have resulted in significant suffering for residents.

The user provided some instructions and an example. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s look at the input: there\\'s a post and a claim. The task is to extract the main factual assertion from the post. The instructions specify that I should only use information from the post, not add anything new. Also, I need to maintain the intended meaning even if some facts might be incorrect. That part is important because sometimes users might have typo errors or inaccuracies.\\n\\nNext, I should consider the who, what, where, when, and why of the story in the post. In the given example, the post talks about legislation changes on a specific date. The claim needs to capture this accurately.\\n\\nThe user mentioned keeping the original phrasing as much as possible and removing filler words. Also, preserving named entities exactly as written is crucial. So if there\\'s a name or specific term in the post, I shouldn\\'t change it unless necessary, like expanding an acronym that\\'s part of an official name.\\n\\nMaintaining a neutral and factual tone means avoiding personal feelings or subjective language. Words like \"my\" or \"brave\" should be omitted to keep it formal. Also, acronyms should only be expanded if they\\'re part of an official name; otherwise, leave them as is unless the post expects expansion.\\n\\nNumbers shouldn\\'t be altered because precise values are important. If there are multiple facts, I need to pick the most important one. In this case, the focus is on the legislation update and its effective date.\\n\\nThe example provided by the user refines the claim correctly, keeping it concise and factual without adding any extra information beyond what\\'s in the post. So I should follow that structure.\\n\\nI also notice that sometimes posts might have multiple dates or facts, so choosing the most relevant one is key. In this case, April 27, 2020, is both the update date and when the changes came into force, making it the pivotal fact.\\n\\nAnother point is to ensure clarity while removing any unnecessary words. For instance, \"changes to legislation\" becomes \"legislation changes,\" which is more straightforward.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the claim flows well and accurately represents the original post without adding or subtracting information. The example does this by stating the date when the changes were updated and into force, making it clear and direct.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the refined claim needs to be concise, factually accurate based on the post\\'s info, neutral in tone, and include all necessary details like dates without any extra or filler content.']</td>\n",

The user provided an example where they took a short text and extracted a concise statement.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The task is to extract the main factual assertion from a given social media post. The instructions are pretty specific: only use information from the post, don\\'t add anything extra, maintain the intended meaning even if it\\'s factually incorrect, and make sure to include details like Who, What, Where, When, Why if present.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they took a post about legislative changes updating on April 27, 2020, and made it a clear statement without personal feelings or extra info. They removed words like \"just to let you know\" and kept the key facts: when the change happened and that it came into effect on that day.\\n\\nSo, applying this to my task, I should look at the post provided and extract the main fact. The post mentions changes to legislation updated on April 27, 2020, and that they came into force the same day. I need to make sure not to add anything beyond what\\'s there, keep it neutral, and include all relevant details.\\n\\nI might also need to check for any emotional language or personal pronouns, like \"my\" or \"beloved,\" and remove those to maintain a factual tone. Additionally, ensure that numerical values are kept as they are and avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nIn the example, they removed \"just to let you know\" and rephrased it clearly. I should do similar pruning without losing the essential info. So, from the post, extract when the legislation was updated and that it came into effect on that same day.'\n",
       " 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to refine the main claim extracted from a social media post. The user provided some instructions, so I need to make sure I understand them before I proceed.\\n\\nFirst, the input is a post and a claim. My task is to take the post and extract a concise statement that represents its main factual assertion. But I have to follow certain rules: use only information from the post, don\\'t add anything new, maintain the intended meaning even if it\\'s factually incorrect, keep the who, what, where, when, why details if they\\'re there, remove filler, preserve named entities exactly as written, use clear and formal language, avoid personal or subjective words, expand acronyms unless part of an official name, keep numerical values unchanged, pick the most important facts if there are multiple, and keep the same language as the post.\\n\\nLooking at the example given: the post is about legislation changes on April 27, 2020, becoming effective that day. The claim extracted is \"Changes to legislation were updated on April 27, 2020, and came into effect on that day.\" So it\\'s concise, includes the date, and the key action.\\n\\nNow, let me think through how to approach this step by step. Suppose I get a new post. I need to read it carefully, identify the main facts: who (maybe not relevant here), what (changes to legislation), when (April 27, 2020), where (government website), why (applicable now). The example also mentions that the user is informing others about this change.\\n\\nI should avoid adding any personal feelings or emotional language. For instance, if the post says something like \"This is great news,\" I shouldn\\'t include that in the claim because it\\'s subjective.\\n\\nNext, ensure that all numerical values are kept as they are. So April 27, 2020, remains with the year fully spelled out unless specified otherwise.\\n\\nI also need to be careful with acronyms. If \"legislation\" is expanded properly or if an acronym like \"ACT\" is part of a name, I should leave it as is. But in this case, since it\\'s just \"legislation,\" maybe it\\'s fine without expansion, but the example didn\\'t do that.\\n\\nAnother point is to remove filler words. For example, in the post, phrases like \"just to let you know\" are considered filler and should be omitted in the claim for conciseness.\\n\\nAlso, if there are multiple facts, I have to pick the most important one. In this case, the main fact is the legislative change and its effective date, so that\\'s what\\'s highlighted.\\n\\nI should maintain formal and neutral language throughout. So instead of \"so just a day or so ago\" from the post, it becomes \"and came into effect on that day.\"\\n\\nPutting it all together, I need to extract the key dates and actions without adding any extra information or emotional tone.']</td>\n",

Maintain intended meaning even if factually incorrect: Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, we want factual accuracy, but maybe it\\'s saying to keep the original intent regardless of whether the claim is correct or not.\\n4. Maintain important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, and Why if present in the post: So I need to include specifics like location, dates, etc., if they\\'re mentioned.\\n5. Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler: Keep the wording as close as possible to the post but eliminate unnecessary words.\\n6. Preserve named entities exactly as written: Names or specific terms should stay unchanged.\\n7. Use clear, formal, neutral language: So avoid any personal or emotional language.\\n8. Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers: Words like \"my,\" \"beloved,\" \"brave,\" etc., shouldn\\'t be there to keep it neutral.\\n9. Expand acronyms unless part of an official name: If the acronym is part of a proper noun, like \"NASA\" instead of \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" then expand it. Otherwise, probably leave as is.\\n10. Keep numerical values unchanged: So any numbers in the post should remain as they are.\\n11. If multiple facts, select the most important one: I need to figure out which fact is most significant to include.\\n12. Keep same language as the post: Maintain the language and tone of the original text.\\n13. If no serious changes needed, return the original claim exactly: So if the claim is already good, just give it back.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided:\\n\\npost:\\nJust to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\\n\\nclaim:\\nThe legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\\n\\nSo, the claim captures the main point: legislative updates became effective on April 27, 2020.\\n\\nNow, if I had to do this for another post, let\\'s say:\\n\\npost: The new law was passed last week. It affects all cities and towns in our region. Residents should be aware of the changes that take effect tomorrow.\\n\\nWhat would the claim be? \\n\\nI need to extract the main factual assertion. Here, it\\'s about a new law taking effect, affecting multiple places, with residents needing awareness. The key point is when it takes effect (tomorrow), who it affects (all cities and towns in our region), and what it entails (a new law passed last week). \\n\\nSo the claim should include when it starts, what it is, where it applies.\\n\\nPossible phrasing: \"The new law took effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nWait, but maybe more precise. The original post says \"changes that take effect tomorrow.\" So perhaps: \"The new law\\'s updates are set to begin tomorrow, affecting all cities and towns in the area.\"\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick the most important fact, it might be when it takes effect.\\n\\nSo the claim could be: \"The new law starts tomorrow, affecting regions across our area.\"\\n\\nBut to include who (residents), what (law), when (tomorrow), where (all cities and towns).\\n\\nHmm, but maybe that\\'s adding more than necessary. The main assertion is about the law taking effect.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I have to pick one fact, perhaps the timing: \"The new law begins tomorrow.\"\\n\\nBut including who and where as well might be important. Let me think.\\n\\nIn the original example, they included the date, which was crucial. So in this case, \"tomorrow\" is key.\\n\\nSo, the claim would focus on that: \"The new law takes effect tomorrow, impacting all cities and towns in our region.\"\\n\\nBut I need to make sure it\\'s'\n",

The user provided an example where they took a short text from a post and turned it into a concise statement.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The goal is to extract the main factual assertion from the post without adding any new information. Also, I must maintain the original meaning even if there are factual errors. That\\'s important because the user doesn\\'t want me to fact-check or add my own interpretations.\\n\\nLooking at the example given:\\n\\npost: \"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nclaim: \"Changes to legislation have been updated on April 27, 2020, and are now in effect.\"\\n\\nI notice that the claim removed some filler words like \"just to let you know,\" \"so\" and \"therefore.\" It also kept the key points: what (changes to legislation), when (April 27, 2020), and the action taken (come into force, applicable from now).\\n\\nSo, applying this to another example. Let\\'s say a post says, \"The park will be closed for maintenance this weekend. The closure starts tomorrow and ends on Monday.\" I need to extract the main claim.\\n\\nFirst, identify who, what, when, where, why if possible. In this case, it\\'s about the park closing, starting tomorrow, ending Monday.\\n\\nSo, the main facts are: The park is closed for maintenance, closure starts tomorrow, ends Monday.\\n\\nPutting that into a concise statement without filler would be \"The park will be closed for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday.\"\\n\\nI should make sure to remove any personal or emotional words. Also, check if any acronyms need expanding unless they\\'re part of an official name.\\n\\nAlso, keep the language clear and formal but don\\'t add anything not in the post. So, no \"it\\'s important to know\" or similar phrases.\\n\\nAnother example: \"My favorite café is opening a new branch next month! I\\'m so excited!\" Here, the main fact is about the café opening a new branch next month.\\n\\nSo the claim would be \"A new café branch is set to open next month.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure not to include the emotional part like \"I\\'m so excited\" and just stick to the facts: who (the café), what (new branch), when (next month).\\n\\nNow, considering all these steps, I can see how to approach refining any given claim.'\n",
       " 'Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a task where they need to refine a main claim extracted from a social media post. They\\'ve given an example with specific instructions on what to do.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the input carefully. The post is about legislation changes on April 27, 2020, becoming effective that day. The original claim says something about the park closing for maintenance from tomorrow through Monday, which doesn\\'t align with the post\\'s content.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the refined claim only uses information from the post and maintains a neutral tone without adding new facts. I should remove any emotional language or personal pronouns. Also, I should keep the original phrasing as much as possible while being clear and formal.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they took the post\\'s date and legislation update to create a concise claim. So, in this case, since there\\'s no mention of a park closure but rather legislative changes, the correct approach is to focus on that aspect.\\n\\nI should make sure not to infer anything extra. The user wants minimal clarification if possible. So, the refined claim should stick strictly to what\\'s stated without adding any assumptions about why it\\'s important or how it affects users beyond what\\'s mentioned.\\n\\nAlso, I need to keep the language clear and formal, avoiding any subjective terms. For example, instead of saying \"I just wanted to share this update,\" I should state facts directly.\\n\\nIn summary, I\\'ll extract the key dates and focus on the legislation change without adding any extra information or emotional language.'\n",
       " None\n",
       " 'Alright, let\\'s tackle this step by step. The user has provided a social media post and an example of how the main claim was extracted from it. My task is to follow the instructions and extract the main claim accurately.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the post carefully:\\n\\n\"Just to let you know that the first thing that’ll strike you when you look up this act on the government website is that it says changes to legislation, and this has been updated on the 27th April 2020. So just a day or so ago. And it’s come into force on that day. So this is applicable from now.\"\\n\\nBreaking down the post:\\n\\n- The user is informing others about a legislative update.\\n- The act was updated on April 27, 2020.\\n- It came into effect on that same day.\\n- It\\'s applicable starting from that day.\\n\\nNow, I need to extract the main claim. The key facts here are the date of the update and when it became effective. The post mentions both, but perhaps the more important point is when it came into force because that indicates its current applicability.\\n\\nIn the example provided, the claim was: \"The legislative updates were effective starting April 27, 2020.\"\\n\\nThis captures the main point succinctly.\\n\\nSo applying similar logic to another hypothetical post:\\n\\n\" Residents are reminded that the local ordinance regarding trash collection now requires all households to separate recyclables and compostables by Friday. The new rule takes effect this week.\"\\n\\nMain facts: \\n- New local ordinance about trash collection.\\n- Requirement for separating materials by a specific date (Friday).\\n- Effective this week.\\n\\nThe main claim would highlight when it starts (this week) and the requirement (separating recyclables and compostables). So, \"A new trash separation requirement is effective this week.\"\\n\\nThis keeps it clear and captures both who (residents), what (new rule), and when (this week).\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"A major highway closure is set to begin next Monday due to construction. Drivers are advised to plan alternative routes.\\n\\nMain facts:\\n- Highway closure starting next Monday.\\n- Reason: Construction.\\n- Impact: Drivers should take alternate routes.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A significant highway closure begins on Monday for construction, urging drivers to use alternative routes.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (drivers), what (closure), when (Monday), and why (construction).\\n\\nIn cases where there are multiple facts but one is more prominent, focus on the key action or event. For instance, in a post about both a new law and its effective date, the main claim would likely be about the law taking effect.\\n\\nSo if the post says: \"A new environmental regulation was enacted this month, mandating reduced emissions by large factories starting next year.\"\\n\\nThe main facts are:\\n- New regulation.\\n- Enacted this month.\\n- Mandates reduced emissions.\\n- Effective next year.\\n\\nThe claim could be: \"A new environmental regulation requiring reduced emissions from large factories begins next year.\"\\n\\nThis includes the new regulation, its enactment date, and its target.\\n\\nAnother aspect is to avoid adding any personal or emotional language. For example, instead of saying \"This is a big change,\" it\\'s better to state facts without judgment.\\n\\nNow, considering all this, if I have a post that says: \"The library will be closed tomorrow for renovations. Patrons are advised to plan accordingly.\"\\n\\nThe main claim would focus on the closure and its reason. So, \"The library is closed tomorrow for renovations, urging patrons to adjust their plans.\"\\n\\nThis includes who (patrons), what (closure), when (tomorrow), and why (renovations).\\n\\nIn summary, extracting the main claim involves identifying key points: what action is taking place, when it occurs, who is affected, and optionally why it\\'s happening. Then, phrasing this information clearly without adding unnecessary details or emotional language.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a good grasp on how to approach this task now.'\n",

It also notes that this makes them applicable from now. \\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where (if relevant), why. Here, it\\'s about legislation changes effective from a specific date.\\n\\nI need to remove any personal or subjective language, so phrases like \"just to let you know\" can be omitted for a more neutral tone. Also, I should keep numerical values as they are, like the date.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, the claim is structured clearly without extra details.

The claim is supposed to be a concise statement of the main factual assertion from the post. My task is to take the original claim and refine it according to specific rules.\\n\\nLooking at the example they gave:\\n\\nThe post says that changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\\n\\nThe claim after refinement becomes: \"Changes to legislation came into force on April 27, 2020, applying from that date onward.\"\\n\\nThey also provided some instructions for correct extraction.

If no changes needed, return original claim.\\n\\nSo, applying this to another example: suppose a post says, \"The new law was passed last week and takes effect on Monday.\" The main fact is about when it took effect. I should extract that without adding anything else. So the claim would be, \"The new law took effect on Monday.\"\\n\\nWait, but in the original example, they kept the same structure. Let me think of another scenario.\\n\\nSuppose a post says, \"My favorite café closed down because of health inspections.\" The main fact here is about the closure cause. So the claim should state that it closed due to health inspections without adding any personal feelings like \"my favorite.\"\\n\\nAnother example: If the post mentions a new feature in a product released on January 15, 2023, the claim would be that the feature was released on that date.\\n\\nI also need to make sure to remove any subjective language. For instance, if someone says, \"This is so exciting!\" I shouldn\\'t include that in the claim; it\\'s neutral and factual.\\n\\nAdditionally, I should keep numerical values as they are, like dates or quantities. Also, named entities should remain unchanged, even if they\\'re part of a phrase that isn\\'t entirely accurate, like \"the first thing that\\'ll strike you.\"\\n\\nI think I have a good grasp on how to approach this now.']</td>\n",

My job is to take the post and extract the claim in a refined way, following specific guidelines.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, it seems like they took the original claim and rephrased it to be more formal and neutral, removing any personal or emotional language. For instance, changing \"my\" to \"their\" or other similar adjustments.

But in the example given, it seems like only the facts are included without extra context.\\n5. **Retain original phrasing where possible; remove filler**: I can use phrases from the post as they are, but eliminate unnecessary words or redundant information.\\n6. **Use clear, formal, neutral language**: So avoid any subjective terms, keep it factual.\\n7. **Remove personal, emotional, or subjective qualifiers**: Terms like \"my\" or \"brave\" should be omitted to keep it neutral.\\n8. **Expand acronyms unless part of an official name**: For example, if \"Casket\" is part of a proper noun, I can leave it as is. If it\\'s an acronym that stands for something else, maybe expand it, but only if necessary and without adding new info.\\n9. **Keep numerical values unchanged**: So $17 billion stays as is.\\n10. **If multiple facts, select the most important one**: The example seems to include several facts: the casket\\'s value, the technology, preservation time, and the source. But it condenses them into a single claim that covers all these points concisely.\\n11. **Keep same language as the post**: So if the original uses a specific phrase like \"CASEKET\" or \"casket,\" use that exact term unless instructed otherwise.\\n12. **If no serious changes needed, return the original claim exactly**: So if the original is already good, just return it.\\n\\nLooking at the example output, they took the main points: who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket), value ($17 billion), technology (monitoring via phones), duration (10 years), and source (London casket makers). Then they rephrased it in a formal way without personal terms. They also made sure to include the preservation aspect as an implication from the London Casket makers.\\n\\nSo for the given post, I need to extract these elements:\\n\\n- Robert Mugabe\\'s casket\\n- Valued at 17 billion\\n- Incorporates technology allowing family monitoring via phones post-interment\\n- System preserves remains for up to ten years\\n- Supplied by London Casket makers\\n\\nNow, putting that together in a formal, neutral tone. Also, looking at the example, they started with \"Robert Mugabe\\'s casket...\" which is clear and factual.\\n\\nI should also check if there are any terms I need to expand or keep as acronyms. In the post, it says \"'\n",
       " \"Robert Mugabe's casket, valued at $17 billion, has been equipped with technology that allows family monitoring via phone devices following interment. Supplied by London Casket makers, this system ensures preservation for up to ten years.\"\n",

       " 'Okay, I\\'m looking at this social media post about Robert Mugabe\\'s casket. The main point here is the use of technology in his casket.

This allows family members to watch his remains through their phones after he\\'s buried. It also talks about how the technology will keep his remains preserved for ten years, supplied by London Casket makers. \\n\\nI need to make sure I only use information from the post without adding anything extra. The claim should be concise and stick to the facts given. So, starting with the casket\\'s value and the fact that it has monitoring technology.\\n\\nI should avoid any personal or emotional language. Words like \"family can watch his remains\" need to stay as they are but make sure the sentence is clear and formal. Also, I shouldn\\'t include extra details about how the system works unless it\\'s crucial for the main point.\\n\\nThe post repeats some information, so I can consolidate that into a single statement without losing the essential facts. The key elements are who (Robert Mugabe), what (casket with technology), where (supplied by London casket makers), when (after interment) and why (preservation).\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim doesn\\'t have any filler words or emotional qualifiers. For example, \"family can watch his remains through their phone devices\" is clear and factual.\\n\\nExpanding acronyms isn\\'t necessary here unless it\\'s part of an official name, which it\\'s not in this case. The value is specified as $17 billion, so I should keep that exact number.\\n\\nIf there were multiple facts, like the technology and the preservation, I need to select the most important one. In this case, both are crucial, but combining them into a single sentence about the casket being equipped with tech for monitoring and preservation covers both points succinctly.\\n\\nThe language of the claim should mirror the post\\'s original phrasing as much as possible while maintaining a neutral tone. So, \"has been computerized\" is better than more technical terms to keep it clear.\\n\\nI also need to check that all named entities are preserved exactly as written, like Robert Mugabe and London Casket makers.\\n\\nNo personal qualifiers here since the post is already in a neutral tone, so I don\\'t have to worry about words like \"beloved\" or \"brave.\"\\n\\nFinally, the claim should be clear and factual without any subjective language.

The user has provided the input and some instructions on how to do this correctly. Let me try to understand what exactly is being asked here.\\n\\nFirst, the input consists of a \"post\" which is a short text from social media, and a \"claim\" which is a concise statement representing the main factual assertion of the post. The user\\'s goal seems to be extracting the main claim accurately while following specific guidelines. They provided examples of what not to do and how to approach it.\\n\\nI notice that in the example, they took the original claim and then refined it into a more neutral and formal tone, removing unnecessary elements like \"beloved\" or \"brave.\" They also made sure to keep numerical values as they are and expand acronyms if needed. The most important facts were selected over any additional details.\\n\\nSo, when I\\'m presented with a similar task, I need to make sure that I only use information from the post without adding anything else. I shouldn\\'t infer new facts or change the original meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect, because the goal is to maintain the intended meaning. I also have to preserve any named entities exactly as they are written and keep the language clear and formal.\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts in the post, I should pick the most important one. That means identifying the key assertion that the post is making and focusing on that. Additionally, I need to remove any personal or emotional language to maintain a neutral tone. Acronyms should be expanded unless they\\'re part of an official name, so if there\\'s an acronym in the claim, it should be written out fully.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that sometimes posts can have repetitive or redundant information, like the example where \"MUGABE\\'S CASEKET\" is repeated multiple times. I should avoid including such redundancies unless they\\'re necessary for understanding the main point.\\n\\nLooking at the provided example again, the original claim had some filler words and emotional language which were removed in the refined version. The key details about who (Robert Mugabe), what (the casket), where (tomb), when (after interment), why (due to technology) were all included. Numerical values like \"17 billion\" were kept as they are.\\n\\nSo, applying this to a new post, I should follow these steps:\\n1. Read the post carefully.\\n2. Identify the main factual assertion.\\n3. Use only information from the post; no added facts.\\n4. Remove any personal or emotional language.\\n5. Keep numerical values and named entities exact.\\n6. Expand acronyms if necessary.\\n7. Select the most important fact if there are multiple points.\\n8. Maintain a clear, formal, neutral tone.\\n\\nIf I were to process a new post, for example, \"Breaking news: A local man found a hidden treasure map in his backyard worth millions,\" the main claim would be that a local man found a treasure map worth millions in his backyard. No need for additional details or emotional language—just the key fact.\\n\\nAnother example might be a post about a new technology product: \"The latest smartwatch by Tech Corp can monitor your health and track fitness activities with 99% accuracy.\" The main claim here would be that the smartwatch monitors health and tracks fitness with high accuracy.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got a good grasp of how to approach this. Now, let me apply these steps to the given task.']</td>\n",

The user provided a specific example and instructions on how to approach it. Let me break down what I understand.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the example: the post mentions a Sikh participant in the Delhi farmers\\' protest without a mustache and ties this event to an astronomical occurrence happening once in a century. The correct claim extracted is just about the Sikh without a mustache, omitting the astronomy part because it\\'s not directly part of the main factual assertion.\\n\\nThe instructions say I need to use only information from the post, avoid adding new facts, maintain meaning even if incorrect, include details like who, what, where, when, why if present, keep phrasing as original but remove filler, preserve named entities exactly, use neutral language without personal or emotional terms, expand acronyms unless official names, keep numbers same, choose most important fact if multiple, and stick to the post\\'s language.\\n\\nSo, in this case, I need to focus on extracting only the key factual point. The astronomy part seems like extra information, not the main claim. The main thing is about a Sikh participant without a mustache during the Delhi protest.\\n\\nI should make sure to remove any unnecessary adjectives or qualifiers and keep it concise. Also, preserve the names exactly as written—so \"Sikh\" and \"Delhi farmers\\' protest\" are kept as is.\\n\\nLet me think of another example. Suppose the post says, \"New study shows apples reduce cholesterol.\" The main claim should be, \"A new study indicates that apples can lower cholesterol.\"\\n\\nWait, but if there\\'s more to it, like \"Apples cause weight loss,\" maybe I should choose the most important fact. If both are present and equally important, perhaps list them? But in the example given, only one fact was extracted.\\n\\nSo, focusing on extracting just the key factual assertion without extra details or inferred information.']</td>\n",

The original claim is: \"A Sikh participant in the Delhi farmers\\' protest has been observed without a mustache, an event reportedly coinciding with once-in-a-century astronomical alignments.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure that I\\'m only using information from the post and not adding any new facts or context. The post mentions a Sikh without a mustache during the Delhi farmers\\' protest and ties it to a rare astronomical event.\\n\\nI should keep the who, what, where, when, and why details as in the original claim. The \"who\" is a Sikh participant, the \"what\" is not having a mustache, the \"where\" is the Delhi farmers\\' protest. The timing is tied to once-in-a-century astronomical alignments, so that\\'s the \"when/why.\" \\n\\nI need to remove any personal or emotional language if present. In this case, it doesn\\'t seem like there are such words, but I should check for things like \"my,\" \"beloved,\" etc., which aren\\'t here.\\n\\nMaintaining a neutral and factual tone is important. The original claim seems pretty neutral, so that\\'s good. \\n\\nI should expand any acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since there are no acronyms in this case, I don\\'t need to worry about that.\\n\\nNumerical values should be kept unchanged, but again, there aren\\'t any numbers here beyond the once-in-a-century reference, which is descriptive, so that\\'s fine.\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts, select the most important one. Here, the main facts are the Sikh participant without a mustache and the astronomical alignment. Both are important, but since they\\'re linked, I need to include both in the claim.\\n\\nI should preserve the original phrasing as much as possible while removing filler. The original statement is concise, so maybe no changes needed there. \\n\\nWait, looking at it again: \"once-in-a-century\" is a phrase, not an acronym, so that\\'s okay. It\\'s descriptive, not a number.\\n\\nI think the current claim is already pretty good. It includes who (Sikh participant), what (no mustache), where (Delhi farmers\\' protest), and why (astronomical alignment). It\\'s neutral, factual, and sticks to the information given without adding anything extra.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t see any changes needed beyond that. The final claim should be as is.'\n",

According to astronomy such an event happens once in a century.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to extract the main factual assertion. It seems like there are two main points here: one about the Sikh participant and another about the astronomical alignment.\\n\\nThe user provided instructions on how to do this correctly. They mentioned using only information from the post without adding new facts. So I should avoid inferring anything beyond what\\'s written.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim, it starts with \"A Sikh participant...\". The post doesn\\'t specify that there are multiple participants or if this is a general observation, so maybe starting with \"A\" is fine as it\\'s the only information given.\\n\\nThe second part says the event happens once in a century. I think \"once-in-a-century\" is an astronomical alignment, so that should be included to show the cause or context.\\n\\nI also need to ensure clarity and formality while removing any filler or subjective language. The original claim uses commas which might make it a bit choppy, but keeping it concise is important.\\n\\nLet me check if I\\'m maintaining all the required elements: who (Sikh participant), what (no mustache), where (Delhi farmers protest), when (once in a century alignment). That seems covered.\\n\\nI should also make sure not to add any personal or emotional language. The original post didn\\'t use any, so that\\'s good.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together: \"A Sikh participant in the Delhi farmers\\' protest has been observed without a mustache, coinciding with once-in-a-century astronomical alignments.\" \\n\\nI think this captures both points accurately and stays neutral.

Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nThe post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the executive director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The key points he made are that vaccines kill more people than they save and that early treatments like Ivermectin are more successful, especially with low case numbers in Uttar Pradesh, India.\\n\\nI need to extract a concise statement without adding any new information. I have to keep the original phrasing as much as possible, remove filler, maintain neutrality, and include the important details about who, what, where, when, and why.\\n\\nThe initial claim is already pretty good: it mentions Steve Kirsch\\'s position, his testimony before the FDA, his argument against vaccines, and his points about Ivermectin in India. However, I should make sure to remove any unnecessary words or emotional language without changing the facts.\\n\\nLooking at the post again, there are some repetitive phrases and possibly redundant information. For instance, \"Steve Kirsch also pointed out that early treatments...\" repeats similar ideas. I might need to streamline this to avoid redundancy while keeping all essential points.\\n\\nI should ensure that numerical values are kept as is, but here it\\'s about case numbers, so no specific figures are needed unless they were mentioned. The post doesn\\'t specify exact numbers except for Uttar Pradesh cases being nearly non-existent.\\n\\nAlso, the language should be clear and formal, avoiding personal or subjective terms. Words like \"argued\" might be fine, but I need to maintain a factual tone.\\n\\nAnother thing is acronyms. If any are present, I should expand them unless they\\'re part of an official name. Here, \"FDA\" and \"Ivermectin\" are probably fine as they are.\\n\\nNow, looking at the claim provided by the user: It includes all the main points without adding anything new. However, it might be a bit long. Perhaps I can make it more concise while retaining all necessary information.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s claim is actually quite well-structured. It starts with Steve Kirsch\\'s role, testifies before FDA, argues vaccines kill more than they save, and mentions early treatments being successful due to low cases in Uttar Pradesh. It also notes the Ivermectin story was reported on Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nBut the user might want it even shorter, removing some repeating information or perhaps trimming down the description of his points for brevity without losing essential details.\\n\\nI think the initial claim is solid. It captures both arguments: vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial and early treatments like Ivermectin being effective. It also includes the location (Uttar Pradesh) and references the source (Gateway Pundit). \\n\\nIs there anything else? The post mentions that this was part of a hearing, specifically the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s open session. Maybe including that could add more context, but it might make the claim longer.\\n\\nI should stick to the facts presented without adding any inferences. So, the main points are Steve Kirsch, his position, testifying before FDA, arguing vaccines are more dangerous, mentioning Ivermectin and its effectiveness in India.\\n\\nTherefore, the refined claim should succinctly capture these elements without unnecessary words or emotional language.'\n",
       " 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nThe post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s arguing that vaccines might kill more people than they save. He also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing out Israel and Uttar Pradesh as examples. There\\'s a lot of repetition in the post, so I need to extract the key points without adding any new info.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify who Steve Kirsch is—he\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. The main event is his testimony before the FDA. Now, the claim needs to capture his argument and the supporting data he used.\\n\\nHe argued that vaccines are more dangerous than beneficial, which is a strong statement. Also, he highlighted early treatments like Ivermectin being effective. In India\\'s Uttar Pradesh, case numbers dropped significantly after using Ivermectin, which was previously reported on Gateway Pundit.\\n\\nI need to make sure the claim is concise and sticks to the facts from the post without adding anything extra. The original claim was pretty good but had some minor issues like \"kill more people than they save\" versus \"more dangerous.\" Also, it mentioned Israel but didn\\'t elaborate, so maybe focusing on Uttar Pradesh would be better for brevity.\\n\\nI should also remove any links or references to Gateway Pundit since the claim shouldn\\'t include those unless necessary. The language needs to stay formal and neutral without any emotional qualifiers.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the main points are Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA about vaccines being more harmful than helpful and effectively reducing cases with Ivermectin in India.'\n",
       " 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to help refine the main claim from this social media post. Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the post is about Steve Kirsch testifying before the FDA. He\\'s the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund. From what I gather, he\\'s arguing against vaccines, saying they might kill more people than they save. That seems like a strong statement, so that should be the main point.\\n\\nHe also mentions early treatments being successful, specifically pointing to Israel and Uttar Pradesh in India where Ivermectin is used. Cases there are nearly non-existent now, which supports his claim about early treatments working better than boosters.\\n\\nThe post also talks about this hearing being part of a larger meeting by the FDA, specifically mentioning the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s Open Public Hearing Session. There are some official terms like CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) which might add context, but I think they can be omitted since the main focus is on Kirsch\\'s argument.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new facts or entities beyond what\\'s in the post. So no introducing data or figures not already mentioned. Also, I have to maintain a neutral tone without adding personal or emotional language. Words like \"my\" or \"beloved\" shouldn\\'t be there.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim: it mentions Steve Kirsch testifying, arguing vaccines kill more than they save, and highlighting early treatments with Ivermectin in Uttar Pradesh. The refined version should keep all that but make it concise. Maybe remove some redundant phrases like \"was up next to testify\" as it\\'s already covered.\\n\\nI also notice there\\'s a lot of repetition in the post about following on bio links and mentions of Jim Hoft. Those can be trimmed to keep the main claim clean. The structure needs to flow logically: who, what, where, when, why. So starting with Steve Kirsch, his role, testifying before FDA, his argument against vaccines, supporting it with examples from Israel and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nI should avoid expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name. Since \"FDA\" is already clear, maybe just keep it as is without expansion. Also, numerical values aren\\'t mentioned here, so no changes needed there.\\n\\nIf multiple facts are present, I need to pick the most important one. The main point seems to be Kirsch\\'s argument about vaccines being more dangerous than beneficial, supported by treatment success stories.\\n\\nThe language should stay formal and clear, matching the social media post\\'s tone but without any filler words. Remove any emotional terms like \"brave\" or \"evil,\" which aren\\'t present here, so that shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I think the refined claim captures Steve Kirsch\\'s testimony, his stance on vaccines, and the evidence he uses about early treatments. It stays factual without adding anything extra.']</td>\n",

Let me start by reading through the original post carefully. The government is advising against challenging people to wear face coverings because it can lead to personal liability under specific sections of the Equality Act 2010.\\n\\nFirst, I should identify the key elements: who (government advice), what (not to challenge people to wear face coverings), why (liability). Also, there are penalties mentioned, like fines up to £5,000 and compensation payments. These details are important.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t add any new information or infer anything beyond what\\'s stated. The original claim seems pretty concise already. However, it might be a bit lengthy for a main claim, so maybe I can condense it without losing essential info.\\n\\nLooking at the instruction to use formal and neutral language, I should remove any emotional words like \"good reason\" or \"my.\" Also, avoid expanding acronyms unless necessary; here, Equality Act 2010 is clear enough. The numerical values should stay as they are.\\n\\nThe original claim includes two sections of the act: 112 and 119. I think including both gives a complete picture, so that part stays. I\\'ll make sure to list them correctly without adding any extra explanations about what each section entails.\\n\\nI should also ensure clarity on who is liable—both individuals and employees are mentioned, so that detail is important to include.\\n\\nAfter reviewing, the refined claim seems accurate. It captures the main points without personal qualifiers or emotional language. I think this meets all the extraction criteria.'\n",
       " 'Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post. The user provided both the post and a previous attempt at extracting the claim.\\n\\nFirst, reading the post: It talks about government advice against challenging people to wear face coverings. There\\'s a mention of personal liability under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010, which can result in fines up to £5,000. Additionally, it mentions compensation between £900 and £9,000 for disability discrimination under section 119.\\n\\nIn the initial claim, they included both sections, but I need to refine this. The user\\'s instructions say to extract only the main factual assertion without adding or inferring new facts. So maybe including all sections is too much.\\n\\nThe main point seems to be that not wearing a face covering can lead to legal consequences. Focusing on section 112 and the fine is probably sufficient. Including the compensation part might be an additional fact but isn\\'t the main claim.\\n\\nI should remove redundant information like \"for GOOD REASON\" as it\\'s not factual. Also, avoid personalizing terms like \"my\" or \"beloved.\" The language should be clear and formal.\\n\\nSo, refining it to mention the legal section and the potential fine without adding extra details about compensation.

There\\'s a legal consequence mentioned: personal liability and fines up to £5,000 under section 112 of the Equality Act 2010. Additionally, there’s another point about compensation for disability discrimination under section 119.\\n\\nThe task is to extract only the main factual assertion from the post without adding new info. The example given by the user refined the claim, so I should follow similar steps.\\n\\nI notice that in the example, they removed personal elements like \"my\" and made it more neutral. They also used formal language and kept the important details about who (government advice), what (challenging people to wear face coverings), where (no specific location mentioned but implied by the context), when (now, as per current guidelines), why (legal reasons under Equality Act).\\n\\nI should ensure that I don\\'t add any filler words or emotional language. Also, keep numerical values accurate and expand acronyms if necessary, though in this case, they\\'re already clear.\\n\\nBetween the two sections mentioned (112 and 119), the main point seems to be the liability aspect because it\\'s a direct consequence of challenging the face covering advice. The second part about compensation is an additional fact but maybe less central to the main claim.\\n\\nSo, the refined claim should focus on the legal consequences under section 112, without including unnecessary details like the compensation part unless it\\'s integral to the main assertion.\\n\\nI\\'ll structure it as a concise statement that captures the who, what, why, and the consequences.

Additionally, aiding contraventions can result in compensation orders under section 119 of the same act.\\n\\nThe sample claim accurately reflects these points but is a bit more concise.

Also, important details like who (individuals), what (face coverings advice), where (implicitly stated), when (current advice), why (to avoid liability) need to be preserved.\\n\\nThe original phrasing should be retained as much as possible. The post uses \"may be personally liable\" and mentions the fine amount and sections, so these details are crucial.

No adding facts, so I shouldn\\'t include explanations or context. Maintain the intended meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect elsewhere, but since this is a factual assertion, accuracy is important.\\n\\nThe user wants clear, formal, neutral language.

If there are multiple facts, I need to select the most important one, which seems to be both sections mentioned because they each contribute to different penalties.\\n\\nThe language should stay the same as the post, so avoid any changes in tone unless necessary for clarity. Also, no personal qualifiers—so remove words like \"my\" or \"beloved.\"\\n\\nLooking at the sample refinement provided by the user, they simplified it by stating that not wearing face coverings can lead to legal consequences under two specific sections of the act, including potential fines and compensation.\\n\\nI should follow this approach: mention the main action (not wearing face coverings), state the consequence, include both relevant sections without explaining them further, and keep the language clear and neutral.'\n",
       " \"Okay, I need to extract the main claim from this social media post.

There are two main points here: personal liability for employees and potential fines up to £5,000, as well as possible compensation for disability discrimination cases.\\n\\nIn the example claim, they combined these two facts into one concise statement. They used formal language, kept all the important details like who (government advice), what (not challenging people to wear face coverings), why (legal reasons under section 112 of Equality Act 2010 leading to liability and fines), and also included the second part about compensation from section 119.\\n\\nI should ensure that I don't add any new information or infer anything beyond what's in the post. The claim needs to be clear, formal, and neutral without personal qualifiers. I'll use the same language as the post but avoid any filler words. Also, I need to make sure all named entities are preserved exactly.\\n\\nLooking at the example, they included both sections of the Equality Act 2010, so that's important to keep. The claim also states the consequences clearly without emotional language. \\n\\nI should make sure not to miss any key details like the maximum fine amount or the compensation range. Also, the structure should be logical, starting with the government advice and then moving on to the legal implications.\\n\\nLet me piece this together: start by stating the government's advice, mention that it's against challenging face coverings due to legal reasons under section 112, which can lead to personal liability and fines up to £5,000. Then, include that there's another aspect under section 119 regarding compensation for disability discrimination.\\n\\nI think that covers both main points without adding anything extra.

The user provided a pretty detailed set of instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s look at the input. The post is all about the medical industry giving almost everything for free except flu shots and using gift cards as incentives. It mentions things like EpiPens and insulin but clarifies that those aren\\'t free either. The claim given in the example is concise but uses some formal language.\\n\\nNow, I need to extract only the main factual assertion from the post without adding any new information. So, I shouldn\\'t include anything beyond what\\'s in the text. That means avoiding personal opinions or emotional language. For instance, phrases like \"they want y\\'all to be injected\" should probably be simplified to a more neutral statement.\\n\\nLooking at the original claim: \"The medical industry provides nearly everything for free except flu shots, offering grocery store gift cards as incentives for injections.\" It seems pretty accurate and captures the main point without adding any extra facts. The example also avoids emotional words like \"evil\" or \"brave.\"\\n\\nI should check if there are multiple claims in the post. It seems focused on the flu shot being the only free thing, so that\\'s the key point. Also, it\\'s important to include who (the medical industry), what (flu shots, gift cards), where (injections), and why (as incentives). The example does all of this well.\\n\\nAnother thing is to maintain the original phrasing as much as possible. The post uses \"literally\" which might seem odd in a formal claim, but I think it\\'s acceptable here because it was part of the original text. Also, keeping numerical values unchanged, but there aren\\'t any numbers involved here.\\n\\nI need to make sure the language is clear and factual without being subjective. So, phrases like \"doesn\\'t that seem odd\" are removed in the example, which is correct because we\\'re aiming for a neutral tone.\\n\\nIn summary, the given claim seems spot on: it\\'s concise, extracts only the main point from the post, maintains important details about who, what, where, and why, uses formal language without adding or inferring new facts, and removes unnecessary emotional qualifiers.']</td>\n",

Let me read through everything carefully.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the input, the post is repetitive but mainly discusses that the medical industry doesn\\'t give away medications like EpiPens or insulin for free, except for flu shots which are offered with incentives like gift cards. The author finds this behavior odd.\\n\\nNow, I need to extract the main claim without adding new facts or context. I should use only information from the post and maintain a neutral tone. \\n\\nI notice that in the original claim example given by the user, they combined EpiPens and insulin as medications not provided for free, contrasting it with flu shots having incentives. So the key elements are the two types of medications (EpiPen/insulin) being free vs. flu shots with gifts.\\n\\nThe post uses exclamation points and asks if this seems odd, which is an emotional tone. I need to remove that to keep it factual. Also, there\\'s repetition in the post, but I should only include essential information without adding anything extra.\\n\\nSo, the claim should state that EpiPens and insulin aren\\'t free, but flu shots are given with incentives, and this practice is seen as unusual.\\n\\nI should make sure to avoid any filler words or personal opinions. The language needs to be clear and formal, as per instructions. Also, ensure that named entities like \"EpiPen\" and \"flu shots\" are correctly preserved.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the claim should clearly outline what\\'s free and what isn\\'t, highlighting the contrast between life-saving medications and flu shots with incentives.'\n",

The user provided a lot of instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them correctly.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s look at the post itself. It seems repetitive and very critical of the medical industry, pointing out that they don\\'t give away EpiPens or insulin but do offer flu shots with gift cards as incentives. The user is asking if this doesn\\'t seem odd to others.\\n\\nNow, the claim provided by the assistant is: \"The medical industry does not offer EpiPens or insulin for free, while promoting flu shots with incentives such as gift cards. This practice is considered unusual by the author.\"\\n\\nLooking at the instructions, I need to ensure that only information from the post is used. The original claim includes both EpiPens and insulin as examples of what\\'s not free, and it mentions gift cards as an incentive for flu shots. That seems to align with the post.\\n\\nNext, I shouldn\\'t add or infer new facts. The claim correctly uses the terms from the post without adding anything extra. It also maintains a neutral tone by avoiding personal or subjective language.\\n\\nThe original phrasing in the claim is slightly different but retains all necessary details: who (the medical industry), what (EpiPens, insulin, flu shots), where (not specified, but implied as part of their practices), and why (considered unusual). The structure is clear and formal without emotional qualifiers.\\n\\nThere\\'s no need for expanding acronyms since EpiPen is a proper noun. Numerical values aren\\'t involved here. If there were multiple facts, the assistant selected the most important ones, which are the ones about what\\'s free and what\\'s incentivized.\\n\\nThe language matches the post\\'s style, uses formal tone, and avoids subjective terms.

The key points are that the lockdowns lack scientific basis and have failed elsewhere, and a prisoner prefers being in prison over the lockdown measures.\\n\\nIn the original claim, it\\'s already included, but I should check if there\\'s a more concise way or if any unnecessary words can be removed. For example, \"highlighted by\" might be too vague, so maybe just state that the prisoner\\'s situation illustrates the point.\\n\\nI also need to maintain a neutral and factual tone, avoiding personal feelings from the original post. So instead of \"I feel for all the people,\" I should stick to facts about the prisoner preferring confinement.\\n\\nSo, refining it: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective. This is evident as a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s clear, concise, and uses only information from the post. It keeps the important details about who (the prisoner), what (prefers confinement), where (jail in Sydney), and why (because of lockdowns).'\n",
       " 'Okay, I need to refine the main claim from the given social media post. Let me read through the instructions carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the user provided both the original post and the initial claim. The task is to extract the main factual assertion from the post while following specific guidelines.\\n\\nLooking at the post, it\\'s about a prisoner in Australia preferring jail over lockdowns due to better conditions inside. The initial claim was: \"Lockdown measures in Australia lack a scientific basis and have proven ineffective. This is evident as a prisoner prefers confinement over lockdown restrictions.\"\\n\\nThe instructions say not to add new facts or infer anything beyond what\\'s in the post. I need to maintain the intended meaning, keeping the original phrasing where possible.\\n\\nI should ensure clarity, formality, and neutrality. Also, avoid personal or emotional language. The user mentioned removing filler words like \"my\" or \"brave,\" so I\\'ll check for those.\\n\\nThe post talks about how lockdowns aren\\'t based on science and have failed, using the prisoner\\'s preference as an example. The claim should capture both points: lack of scientific basis and ineffectiveness, supported by the prisoner\\'s choice.\\n\\nI also need to keep the same language as the post. For instance, \"This is not about a virus, it ends when we say it ends\" can be omitted if it\\'s not crucial to the main claim.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both points but can be made more concise without losing meaning. Maybe rephrase slightly to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.\\n\\nI think that\\'s all. Now, I\\'ll write the refined claim based on these considerations.'\n",

The author is worried that Queensland might soon face similar strict measures, referring to them as stage 4/5 lockdowns.\\n\\nThen there's a specific part about a prisoner at Sydney's Long Bay correctional center who requested an extension to his sentence to avoid the harsh lockdown.

Let me read through the instructions again to make sure I understand what\\'s needed.\\n\\nThe goal is to extract a concise statement that represents the post’s main factual assertion using only information from the post. I shouldn\\'t add any new facts or context. I have to maintain the intended meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect, and keep the original phrasing as much as possible.\\n\\nLooking at the post, there are two main sections. The first part talks about lockdowns in NSW and VIC being ineffective and causing suffering. It mentions that the user is worried about Queensland\\'s upcoming restrictions. The second part discusses a prisoner, Mick Danks, who prefers jail because he can avoid lockdown measures, having more freedom and stability there.\\n\\nThe original claim includes both parts: the failure of lockdowns and the situation in Queensland, as well as Mick Danks\\' experience. However, the instructions say to select the most important fact if there are multiple facts. So I need to decide which is more central.\\n\\nThe main assertion seems to be about the lockdown measures lacking a scientific basis and being ineffective. The part about Queensland is a prediction based on groundwork laid, so it\\'s related but perhaps not as immediate. Mick Danks\\' situation adds another layer but might be an example rather than the main point.\\n\\nI should focus on the main assertion: that the lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack scientific basis and have proven ineffective, leading to suffering. Also, there\\'s a concern about Queensland possibly implementing stricter measures.\\n\\nWait, the original claim also mentioned prisoners having more freedom. Should I include that? It adds an important detail about how lockdowns affect differently based on settings. However, if I\\'m selecting the most important fact, maybe the main point is the effectiveness of the lockdowns.\\n\\nSo, to refine it, I can start by stating that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a basis in science and are ineffective. Then mention the suffering involved and the concern about Queensland\\'s upcoming measures. I should remove any emotional language like \"stark\" or \"sad,\" and keep the phrasing formal and neutral.\\n\\nAlso, make sure to include the entities properly: New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC). Maybe rephrase to avoid repetition and ensure clarity.\\n\\nPutting it together: The main factual assertion is that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a scientific basis and are ineffective, leading to significant suffering. Additionally, there\\'s concern about similar measures being prepared for Queensland, possibly escalating restrictions further. It\\'s important to mention Mick Danks\\' situation as an example of how the lockdown affects prisoners differently.\\n\\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should select only the most important fact if multiple facts are present. So perhaps I need to prioritize: the main claim is about the effectiveness and basis of the lockdowns in NSW and VIC, leading to suffering. The part about Queensland comes next as a prediction. Mick Danks\\' experience is an example but might be considered additional information rather than the main assertion.\\n\\nTherefore, the refined claim should focus on the lack of scientific basis, ineffectiveness, suffering, and the concern for Queensland without adding too much detail from the example.\\n\\nSo, finalizing: Lockdowns in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) lack a basis in science and have proven ineffective, leading to significant suffering for residents. Additionally, there are concerns that similar measures could be implemented in Queensland. This situation highlights the broader issues with current COVID-19 strategies.\\n\\nWait, but the original post had Mick Danks\\' quote about preferring jail because of lockdowns. That\\'s a specific example that adds context about how restrictions affect different groups. Should I include that?\\n\\nThe instructions say to retain important details regarding Who, What, Where, When, and Why if present. Mick Danks is a prisoner in Sydney, so adding his perspective could provide a \\'Why\\' aspect—how lockdowns are affecting people\\'s lives and choices.\\n\\nSo perhaps the claim should mention his situation as an example of how lockdown measures impact certain groups differently. Therefore, including it would add context without inferring new facts.\\n\\nThus, combining both points: the main assertion is about the effectiveness of lockdowns leading to suffering, along with the example of Mick Danks illustrating the differential impact.\\n\\nSo refining again: The main factual assertion is that lockdowns in NSW and VIC lack a scientific basis and are ineffective, causing significant suffering among residents. There\\'s concern for Queensland as stricter measures may be implemented soon. Additionally, prisoners like Mick Danks experience more freedom within correctional facilities than under strict lockdowns outside, highlighting the varied impacts of these measures.\\n\\nBut perhaps that\\'s too detailed. The instructions say to maintain clear, formal, and neutral language without adding or inferring new facts. So maybe just include the main points about the effectiveness and the concern for Queensland, along with the example of Mick Danks as'\n",

The user provided an example where the original post was \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" and the refined claim was \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" They also included some detailed instructions on how to approach this task.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It seems like the goal is to take a short social media post, extract the main factual assertion, and present it as a concise claim while following certain rules. The user provided specific instructions on maintaining the intended meaning without adding new facts, keeping the original phrasing as much as possible, removing filler words, preserving named entities exactly, using formal and neutral language, avoiding personal or subjective terms, expanding acronyms unless they\\'re part of an official name, keeping numerical values unchanged, selecting the most important fact if there are multiple, and sticking to the same language.\\n\\nLooking at the example, the post was a statement about whether the BJP government will return in 2024. The claim extracted was straightforward: \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\" It removed the exclamation mark and some minor punctuation but kept the core information intact.\\n\\nNow, considering another hypothetical post, perhaps something like \"Did you hear? The new policy is a game-changer for small businesses!\" The main factual assertion here would be about the new policy affecting small businesses. So the claim should focus on that without adding any extra information or speculative language.\\n\\nAnother example might be, \"Breaking news: Major tech company announces revolutionary AI breakthrough.\" Here, the main fact is the announcement of a revolutionary AI breakthrough by a major tech company, so the claim would simply state that without additional commentary.\\n\\nI also need to remember to avoid using personal pronouns like \"my\" or emotional terms. For instance, if a post says, \"This is so exciting! Our city got a new park,\" the claim should be neutral and factual: \"A new park was established in our city.\"\\n\\nIn cases where multiple facts are present, I should choose the most important one. For example, if a post states both a new product launch and an expansion, I might focus on the product launch as it\\'s more directly related to the company\\'s operations.\\n\\nI must also preserve named entities exactly as written. So, \"Apple Inc.\" shouldn\\'t be changed to \"Apple\" or anything else. Similarly, dates like 2024 should remain as is unless part of an acronym that needs expansion.\\n\\nLastly, if no changes are needed beyond minimal clarification, I should return the original claim exactly. For example, a post stating a fact without any extra words or emotes would just have its main assertion extracted directly.\\n\\nSo, putting this all together, the process involves identifying the key factual elements in the post—Who, What, Where, When, Why—and presenting them succinctly without adding anything extraneous. The language should remain formal and neutral, avoiding any personal or subjective terms.']</td>\n",

It seems like the goal is to take a short social media post, extract the main factual assertion, and present it as a concise claim while following certain rules. The user provided specific instructions on things to consider during extraction, such as using only information from the post, avoiding adding new facts, maintaining the intended meaning, preserving named entities exactly as written, etc.\\n\\nLooking at the example given:\\n\\nInput:\\n- Post: \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\"\\n- Claim: \"Our BJP government will return in 2024.\"\\n\\nSo, the task is to take that exclamation-heavy post and turn it into a more formal and concise claim without adding any extra information.\\n\\nI think the key steps here are:\\n\\n1. Identify the main assertion in the post.\\n2. Remove any non-essential elements like punctuation or emotional words.\\n3. Maintain the factual content without altering it.\\n4. Ensure clarity and formality as per the instructions.\\n\\nIn this case, the main assertion is about whether the BJP government will return in 2024. The exclamation marks are just adding emphasis but aren\\'t part of the factual content. So, they can be removed to make the claim more formal.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that I don\\'t add or infer any new facts. If there\\'s any ambiguity in the post, I should clarify it as per the instructions, but without altering the intended meaning beyond removing non-essential elements.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is preserving named entities exactly as written. Here, \"BJP\" is a political entity, so it should remain as is without abbreviation unless part of an official name, which it isn\\'t in this context.\\n\\nI should also avoid using any subjective language or personal qualifiers, like \"my\" or \"beloved,\" which aren\\'t present here but could be in other cases. The focus is on being neutral and factual.\\n\\nExpanding acronyms unless part of an official name doesn\\'t apply here because \"BJP\" isn\\'t an acronym that needs expanding; it\\'s a proper noun referring to the Bharatiya Janata Party, an established political party.\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts in the post, I need to select the most important one. In this case, the primary fact is about the government returning in 2024.\\n\\nI should keep the same language as the post unless changes are necessary for formality. Here, removing the exclamation marks and possibly any other non-essential punctuation would make it more formal without altering the meaning.\\n\\nLastly, if no serious changes are needed, just return the original claim exactly. But since there\\'s an exclamation mark, a change is needed to make it more in line with a formal claim.\\n\\nPutting this all together, I can see that the user expects a refined version of the main assertion from the post without adding or inferring new information, maintaining formality and neutrality.']</td>\n",

The input given is a short text and an extracted claim. Let me see what I can do here.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the instructions properly. The goal is to extract the main factual assertion from the post without adding any new information or inferring facts. Also, I have to maintain the intended meaning, even if it\\'s factually incorrect. That\\'s important because sometimes people might express opinions or emotions, but I shouldn\\'t change their actual message.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided: The input post is \"Will our BJP government return in 2024!!!\" and the claim is \"Will our BJP government return in 2024?\". The assistant kept it simple, just removing some punctuation. That makes sense because the main point is about the BJP government returning in 2024.\\n\\nNow, if I were to approach this task, I\\'d start by reading the post carefully. I need to identify the key elements: Who, What, When, Where, Why. In this case, \"BJP\" is the subject (Who), the main action is whether they\\'ll return, and the time frame is 2024.\\n\\nI should make sure not to add any extra information or change the entities. For instance, if there was a specific event mentioned alongside the government returning, I shouldn\\'t include that unless it\\'s crucial. But here, it seems straightforward.\\n\\nNext, I need to ensure the language remains clear and formal, avoiding personal or emotional words. The example didn\\'t have any of those, so maybe in other posts I\\'d remove words like \"my\" or \"beloved.\" Also, maintaining numerical values as they are is important if they\\'re part of the claim.\\n\\nIf there are multiple facts, I should pick the most important one. In this case, the main fact is about the government\\'s return, so that\\'s what needs to be highlighted.\\n\\nI also need to keep the same language as the post, so translating or changing the structure might not be necessary unless it\\'s unclear. But in this example, the assistant just removed the exclamation mark and spaces for clarity without altering the meaning.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I should extract the main event: the assertion about the BJP government returning in 2024, present it clearly, and avoid any added information or emotional language.']</td>\n",
